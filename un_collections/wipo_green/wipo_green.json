In addition, by generating fine bubbles with their contact area per size being large, it can increase the frequency of contact of fluids. In particular, in the case of Jet Aerator, it is an essential device in improving the rate of digestion of aerobic microbes to them air supply can be a key issue.  Unlike the previous air suppliers, which are configured to have a shape of straight line so that they may be much restrained from generating whirlpool, this technology is completely rounded as well as fan-shaped.

In this respect, it is simpler than the existing water treatment apparatuses and can save the installation space. Also, retention time is no more than 10 minutes, so it is possible to treat water quickly. Moreover, the efficiency of SS and total phosphorus removal is relatively high and can decrease the cost for repair and maintenance greatly.\n\nIn terms of economic feasibility, the upflow water treatment apparatus by the technology requires about 92,778 thousand KRW per year including the costs of electricity, chemical agents and filter media supplement, etc. on the basis of 17 thousand tons of treated water per day. However, in the case of the existing disc-filtration apparatus, the cost of filter media supplements is so high that it requires about 231,823 thousand KRW per year. In the case of multi-layer filtration apparatus, about 146,340 thousand KRW is needed per year. Hence, it can be said that the upflow water treatment device by this technology is superior to those devices by the conventional technology in terms of economic feasibility.\n\nIn the environmental terms, the technology can reduce the consumption of chemical agents greatly, and the amount of backwash water is nothing but 3% of that of influent water (other technologies require about 5 %). Thus, the discharge of sludge is low as compared to the previous technologies, so it is advantageous in that it can reduce the overload on the environment.","type":"Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Pollution & Waste > Waste treatment","development_stage":"Proven record of commercial use","project_summary":"A upflow water treatment apparatuses in the technology have been installed and in normal operation in the wastewater treatment plant in Keum-chon, Paju (with a capacity of 17,000 tons per day) and the wastewater treatment plant in Mun-san, Paju (with a capacity of 9,500 tons per day). If this technology is introduced, the efficiency of SS and total phosphorus removal is high (0.2 ppm for SS and 0.3 mg\/L for total phosphorus) in the technological terms. So, it is appropriate to the standard of influent water, and it is unnecessary to stop operation for cleaning a filtration tank. Also, since it is possible to realize the completely automatic operation, it is advantageous in that the effective management of wastewater treatment facilities is possible.

Therefore, an important task in condensed\nmatter physics is to find new ways to harvest ambient\nthermal energy, particularly at the smallest length scales\nwhere electronics operate.\n\nThe invented system is really a simple one, which exploits certain properties of quantum dots to harvest heat.\nDespite this simplicity, the power it could generate is still larger than any other nano engine that has been considered until now.\n\nThe engines would be microscopic in size, and have no moving parts. Each would only produce a tiny amount of power a millionth or less of what a light bulb uses. But by combining millions of the\nengines in a layered structure, Jordan says a device that was a\nsquare inch in area could produce about a watt of power for\nevery one degree difference in temperature.

Installing solar panels on user\u2019s homes, schools, libraries, hospitals help combat greenhouse gas emissions, reduce deforestation and reduces people  dependence on fossil fuel and woods as source of energy. Traditional electricity is sourced from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. When fossil fuels are burned to create energy, they emit toxic gases that are the primary cause of pollution and global warming.  Not only are fossil fuels bad for the environment, they're a finite resource.  \n\n Lack of access to electricity and modern energy sources profoundly limits                economic development, constrains people\u2019s life chances and traps millions in  extreme poverty.  Around 88% of the DRCongo\u2019s population, about 65 million people, have no access to electricity at all. Lack of electricity in the democratic republic of Congo remains one of  the biggest barriers to the development and prosperity, and continues to trap millions of people  in extreme poverty.  As a result, quality of life is severely diminished, resulting in needless  deaths and stifled economic growth.    \nIn 2015, of the 75 million people living in DRCongo, nearly 65 million people in DRCongo heat their homes and cook using traditional fuels like wood and dung. Inhalation of the smoke and fumes produced from burning traditional fuels results in over two million deaths per year, due  to diseases related smoke. mainly among women and children. That\u2019s more deaths than from malaria and HIV\/AIDS combined.       Additionally, 3% of forests and biodiversity are destroyed due to deforestation caused by  people that use wood as source of energy.  With a third of all health centres and  primary schools lacking any access to electricity, that means that ten million students and 20 million patients are left being educated and receiving health care from places that have no power. Nearly 60% of refrigerators used in health clinics in DRC have unreliable electricity, compromising the safe storage of      vaccines and medicines.      Hospitals are sometimes forced to operate with no lighting or power for equipment, putting people\u2019s lives at serious risk. Children without domestic lighting struggle to do their homework in the evening, which negatively impacts their education and hampers their ability to fulfill their potential. To provide people with innovative energy source, we have develop a solution to overcome this challenge. Avosolar an innovative efficient and low cost solar cells. We have developed Avosolar on the  principle that sunlight can be concentrated in Nanowires due to a resonance effect. This effect can result in producing low cost and more efficient solar cells, allowing more than 98% of the energy from the sun to be converted to electricity and that will cost 10 times less expensive than traditional solar cells. In fact, Due to some unique physical light absorption properties of nanowires, the limit of how much energy we can utilize from the sun's rays is higher than previous believed. These results demonstrate the great      potential ofdevelopment of nanowire-based solar cells.

The current world fleet is constituted of 100 000 commercial ships and 1 000 000 fishing ships. \nMoreover, shipping is estimated to have emitted 1 046 million tonnes of CO2 in 2007, which corresponds to 3.3 % of the global emissions during 2007 according to the Second IMO GHG Study. \n\nKite operation on ships has many advantages:\n By taking advantage of wind, which is a 100 % renewable energy, the ship\u2019s energetic needs are reduced. Depending on the required efficiency, kite propulsion can relieve the conventional diesel engine. According to the report of the United Nations \u201cReview of Maritime Transportation\u201d, a kite auxiliary propulsion system can save up to 20 % fuel. For instance, a container ship fuel consumption is about 150 000 litres per day. Using a kite as auxiliary propulsion system, the fuel saving could amount to 30 000 litres per day (i.e. about $ 20 000 per day).\n Reduction of CO2 can be achieved through greater fuel efficiency or reduced fuel oil consumption. In this field, kite operation would reduce the greenhouse gas emission by 20 %. Taking into account the fact that current world fleet is constituted of 100 000 commercial ships and 1 000 000 fishing ships, kite propulsion would have a major impact on the environment.\n Kite operation on ship has advantages in term of security. In fact, in case of damage, a kite system can be used to have a better visibility. Furthermore, a kite can be used as a propulsion system to reach a port autonomously.\n Compared to a conventional sail rig, one of the main advantages is that it does not generate any capsizing moment. This is a significant aspect in the case of a container ship. \n A kite is easily adaptable to commercial ships, fishing ships, military ships or yachts. Indeed, it does not need a spacious infrastructure on the ship deck. \n\nUsing a 320m\u00b2 kite, fuel economy would reach 25% on the North Atlantic route (corresponding to 134 tonnes of CO2), which is a major benefit, since maritime transportation represents 90 % of the global trade.","type":"System or software, Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Transportation > Maritime\/Waterways\nEnergy > Wind","development_stage":"Under R & D","project_summary":"The aim of the project \u201cbeyond the sea\u00ae\u201d is to develop kite auxiliary propulsion system devices.

Outline\nCupric chloride etchant waste is discharged from the print circuit board manufacturers. The etchant waste is characterized by a very low pH and high cupric ion and chloride ion concentrations.\nThe EOCOR Process is an on-site recycling technology of the cupric etchant waste. And the product of EOCOR Process is cupric oxide which can be used as a raw material of plating process.\nFor on-site recycling technologies, one of the biggest challenges is to avoid chloride contamination. The copper plating process requires precise control of the chloride concentration, which affects the performance of copper plating. Thus, chloride should be removed from recycled copper, even though cupric oxide etchant waste contains a much higher concentration of chloride ion, as mentioned above. For this reason, on-site copper recycling technologies to produce recycled copper with a low content ratio of chloride have become highly desirable.\nThe EOCOR Process can produce the low chloride content CuO because the etchant waste is added stepwisely to the NaOH solution. And according to the optimization of the reaction conditions, we confirmed the produced CuO can be used as a raw material of plating process.\n\n2. The process of EOCOR reaction\na  For CuO recovery, the etchant waste and H2O2 solution were mixed and stirred (Process A). \nb  The mixture of etchant waste and H2O2 solution was added to NaOH solution, stirring continuously (Process B). \nc  After the stirring of the NaOH solution, we repeated stepwise the mixing and addition process till the terminal pH was reached. \nd  The slurry of CuO product was washed with deionized water several times and dried afterwards, and the properties of the dried CuO were described.\n\n3. The optimization of the reaction conditions\nWe optimized the reaction condition on laboratory experiment. As the result, the final pH of the reaction and the temperature of NaOH solution affect to the chloride content of produced CuO.\n\n4. The pilot scale experiment\nBased on the optimized conditions established by the lab-scale experiments, the on-site trial production of CuO from real cupric chloride etchant waste was carried out at a PCB factory. The operation time per batch was about two hours. The throughput of the trial plant was 55 L of etchant waste per batch. We ran the pilot plant for 14 batches and washed part of the CuO slurry. We then successfully obtained about 20 kg-dry weight of refined CuO powder. The chloride content of the refined CuO powder was measured to be around about 80 mg-Cl\/kg-CuO. The removal ratio of copper from the etchant waste was almost 100%, since the soluble cupric content of the supernatant was below 2 mg\/L. \n\nThis fact clearly shows that our proposed recycling technology is applicable to actual etchant waste treatment and that the optimized conditions are efficient for actual use.\n\n5. The first practical plant\nBased on the pilot trial, we constructed the first practical plant in Vietnam. The throughput of the plant was 10 t\/d of etchant waste. The chloride content of the recovered CuO was 85 mg-Cl\/kg-CuO, and the plant produced stable CuO for eight months.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Curing and drying of turmeric using fuelwood (absence of alternative energy source)","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"Kenya Climate Innovation Centre","date_posted":"December 01, 2015","last_updated":"December 01, 2015","meta_category":"need","resources_saved":null,"benefits":null,"type":null,"technical_fields":"Energy > Solar","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Cyber-Physical Bike: A Step Towards Safer Green Transportation","sector":"Transportation","submitted_by":"Rutgers University","date_posted":"May 26, 2016","last_updated":"May 26, 2016","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"Since the CyberBike collects the data utilized in this determination, such group matching is based upon a quantitative rather than qualitative (often anecdotal) assessment, ensuring accurate matching.","type":null,"technical_fields":"Transportation > Road","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Cyclic redox substrate for hydrogen\/syngas production and carbon dioxide capture","sector":"Pollution and Waste","submitted_by":"North Carolina State University","date_posted":"November 25, 2015","last_updated":"November 25, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1) Shows high stability at very high temperatures (1100 oC) and has excellent oxygen carrying capacity (~20 w.t.%).  \n\n\n2) Redox catalyst will be highly resistant towards sintering. \n\n\n3) Coke formation, a major contributor to tar removal catalyst deactivation, is not thermodynamically favored.  \n\n\n4) Inhibits carbon formation and sulfur poisoning, thus preventing catalyst deactivation.  \n\n\n5) Syngas produced is suitable for Fischer-Tropsch process. \n\n\n6) Can completely oxidize fuel to CO2 \/H2 O, and split H2 O to generate H2.  \n\n\n7) Made with common materials, hence highly cost-effective.

The minimum EER to become viable for heat driven cooling is considered to be 10. Primary energy consumption is 8 times lower than a generic conventional air conditioning unit. \nFreescoo is highly compact, modular and standardized solution: the target air conditioning unit with 2.5kW cooling power and 4.7kW heating power, dimensioned for a residential unit from 30 to 40 m2 in Southern Europe. Thanks to its modularity, freescoo can reach a wide range of applications for air conditioning in residential and small tertiary buildings (offices, commercial units). The product is standardized, compact and plug and play solution (error free installation and high cost reduction potential) . \nFreescoo can easily be integrated with solar energy: the electricity needed to drive the system is very low (200W), while benchmark conventional electricity driven air conditioning unit with the same cooling power absorbs 1.2 kW, hence the system can also work as completely stand-alone system without electricity grid connection using PV. Moreover, the use of low temperature heat for the regeneration cycle (55 Celsius degree) allows an efficient integration with flat plate solar collectors. \nFreescoo is environmentally friendly: no use of refrigerant fluids (used in conventional compression air conditioning units), no use of ammonia or lithium bromide (used in absorption heat driven chillers). LCA showed environmental impact of only 6 percent than benchmark solution2. \nFreescoo stores heat in the form of dry silica gel, allowing to keep working for 3-5 hours in dehumidification mode without heat supply and solar radiation. \nFreescoo is at least 60 percent cheaper (1500 -2000 \u20acper kW vs 3800\u20ac per kW) compared to Exhaust Air Heat Pump (EAHP), the only alternative solutions providing complete air conditioning solution in one device: cooling, dehumidification, heating and ventilation with heat recovery in the conditioned space.","type":"Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Green Products > Products that save water\/energy","development_stage":"At usable level","project_summary":"So far, main milestones achieved have been:\n- Intellectual property and trademark protection: patents covering freescoo technology have almost completed the path for final registration in EU, US and Japan; freescoo trademark was registered,\n- Technology validation: technology has been successfully tested in relevant environment and validated by scientific partners ENEA and University of Palermo, further tests of building integrated freescoo is planned in 2017 in 6 demo buildings in Italy and Cyprus in the framework of H2020 demo project Zero Plus project.\n- Image building: the experimental results have been presented at the most important international events related to solar cooling in the last 3 years, leading to recognition of freescoo as one of the most promising solutions by the expert group on Solar Heating and Cooling (SHC) Programme of the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n- Participations in national and EU Research and Development projects","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"DOPA-Melanin Films and Particles as Antimicrobial Compound Carriers and Heavy Metal Scavengers","sector":"Water","submitted_by":"Northwestern University","date_posted":"December 23, 2015","last_updated":"December 23, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1) Simple methods to synthesize DM films and particles\n\n\n2) Easily deposited on a range of substrates","type":null,"technical_fields":"Water > Other\nChemicals & Advanced Materials > Other","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Darwed Village Earth Pan","sector":"Pollution and Waste","submitted_by":"East Africa Climate Innovation Network (EACIN)","date_posted":"November 18, 2013","last_updated":"June 10, 2014","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Water","benefits":"Water that would have naturally gone to waste is saved.","type":"Process","technical_fields":"Pollution & Waste > Recycling & reuse","development_stage":"At usable level","project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Data Analysis and process control for water management","sector":"Water","submitted_by":"Ministry of Economy","date_posted":"December 26, 2015","last_updated":"December 26, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1.

Operation of a tractor with a trailer modified with the EGT system will allow the fuel economy to increase above traditional fully loaded ratings because the EGT reduces the loading effect on the drivetrain of the tractor. With modifications or changes to the tractor\u2019s engine to match the new load requirements for the EGT will allow fuel economy of the tractor to increase even higher.\n\nAn unmodified tractor used to tow class-8 trailers are setup to operate against the maximum loading effect of the combination of the tractor and trailer, and its cargo, to achieve best fuel economy with a full load. Class-8 tractors \u2018without a trailer attached\u2019 routinely operate near an average of 11.5 to 14.5 mpg. Fuel economy for the tractor with a fully loaded trailer will average 5.6 to 7.2 mpg. Operation of the tractor with a trailer modified with an EGT retrofit will allow the fuel economy to increase up to 11 to 13 mpg pulling a fully loaded trailer.\n\nWith introduction of the EGT it will allow OEMs to develop new systems to match safety requirements for the new loading effect offered by the EGT into the transportation industry.  Significant advances in fuel economy across the transportation industry can easily exceed the \u2018retrofit fuel economy\u2019 and achieve 12 to 15 mpg and higher.\n\nDrawings illustrated in figures 1 and 2 demonstrate two basic functions for the EGT assembly. Figure 1 shows the rest position with no force applied to the top input pivot, item 1. The lever arm is mounted about the axle to allow the lever arm to rotate as required and this connection also serves as the fulcrum pivot item 2.  Below the fulcrum is the output pivot item 3, where the weight of the trailer and its load is attached to allow the primary weight to be below the fulcrum (axle). With the primary weight below the axle and no force applied at the top input pivot, weight at the bottom pivot will force the lever arm assembly to have a vertical alignment.\n\nFigure 2 shows the lever arm offset to be 10 degrees away from the rest position as a result of the tractor applying an increasing force to initialize operation of the EGT. To understand operation of the concept it is important to realize the input pivot is being pulled forward by the effort of the tractor supplying force. As you learn the system you will realize the weight of the trailer is 62,500 pounds and will have substantial inertia. As the lever arm begins to rotate about the fulcrum pivot half of the weight, 31,250 pounds, will be at the rear of the trailer attached to the bottom pivot developing potential energy based on the angle of displacement about the fulcrum.\n\nIllustration used in figure 2 indicates an offset angle of 10 degrees to explain operation of the concept whereas the actual operational offset angle for flat operation is very small and would not show displacement in this type drawing. As a natural course of events an offset positions that is higher will generate higher potential energy and will create increasing levels of acceleration.","type":"Process, Design, Material, Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Transportation > Road","development_stage":"Under R & D","project_summary":"In reality the axles and wheels will move first because the weight of the axles and wheels make up only 3.2% of the total weight of the trailer which has a weight of 62,500 pounds. When force is applied to the EGT lever assembly\/s it will have the weight of the trailer attached to the bottom pivots while the axles are attached to the second pivot positions above the output pivots. The top pivot locations are at the 5:1 ratio input position that controls operation of the EGT.\n\nWith an input force creating an action of pulling the lever arm\/s forward, that action will generate a reaction at the bottom pivot of attempting to rotate the trailer\u2019s weight about the axle pivots. Any rotation about the axle pivots will develop a level of potential energy and in the initial 10 degrees the response will have a near flat horizontal force acting against the axle pivots. When the potential energy level reaches and then exceeds the rolling resistance against the wheels, motion can be established. This will happen when the level of potential energy develops from transitioning a portion of the trailers weight that matches, exceeds the loading effect, and then is maintained to control the motion of the trailer.\n\nThis technology is the next step toward electrification of the class-8 group of vehicles.  Reality is this system will crossover into any weight class to provide the same advantages to improve fuel economy and\/or eliminate the use of fuel all together.\n\nTraditional highway operation occurs between 0 and 6 percent of grade and as the below chart indicates the actual incline in degrees is less than the \u2018percent of grade\u2019. As the above spreadsheet indicates operation on a \u20181 degree\u2019 incline will require 1,396 pounds of force to match the load of the vehicle. Operation using the EGT will provide the same operation using a force of 279.2 pounds thus providing a reduction in the standard power requirements by 1,116.8 pounds.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Eco Stove Project","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"UNOSSC","date_posted":"July 31, 2014","last_updated":"July 31, 2014","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"It is a system due to its functionality benefits to the user: cooking, lighting, phone charging and much more.","type":null,"technical_fields":"Energy > Energy storage","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Eco friendly mechanical weeding system","sector":"Farming and Forestry","submitted_by":"Ethiopia Climate innovation Center","date_posted":"August 30, 2016","last_updated":"August 30, 2016","meta_category":"need","resources_saved":null,"benefits":null,"type":null,"technical_fields":"Farming & Forestry > Alternative to chemical pesticides\/insecticides\/fertilizers","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Eco-friendly Self Sustaining Electricity Generator","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"Osas Solutions","date_posted":"July 07, 2016","last_updated":"July 15, 2016","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Oil, Natural gas, Electricity, Land, Air, Other","benefits":"There is self sustaining electricity production,\nThe energy production is eco friendly, \nThe device is cheap because materials needed for its production are readily available.\nThe device is portable,\nIt has a wide application from powering homes and businesses to serving as energy source for automobiles.","type":"Design, Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Energy > Energy generation (Others)","development_stage":"Under R & D","project_summary":"This technology is very unique.

greatly lowers costs in the removal of nitrogen from wastewater by reducing the oxygen demand for nitrification by at least 38 percent compared to conventional methods - aeration is often 50 percent of wastewater plant operating costs. It also lowers costs by significantly reducing the amount of waste biomass produced - this is often the 2nd highest operational cost of wastewater treatment plants. This process can also double or triple the methane produced from organic matter by significantly reducing the amount of organic reducing power needed in denitrification. In conventional denitrification, nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas, a process that consumes 5 electron equivalents that comes from organic matter. In this process, nitrite is converted to nitrous oxide, a process that consumes 2 electron equivalents. Converting nitrite to nitrous oxide requires 60 percent less organic matter in denitrification and enables much more organic matter to be converted to methane - a renewable source of energy. Furthermore, this process offers greater robustness and shorter start-up times as compared to alternative nitrogen short-circuit cycles by utilizing fast growing organisms and very fast abiotic reactions.","type":"Process","technical_fields":"Pollution & Waste > Waste treatment\nEnergy > Waste to energy","development_stage":"Under R & D","project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"High Surface Area Carbon and Process for its production","sector":"Green Products","submitted_by":"University of Missouri Columbia","date_posted":"December 08, 2015","last_updated":"December 08, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"Provides more storage and\/or adsorption in a given space and\/or with a given amount of adsorbent.","type":null,"technical_fields":"Other Areas > Other Areas\nGreen Products > Other","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"High Surface Area Mesoporous Activated Carbon From Waste Biomass","sector":"Pollution and Waste","submitted_by":"National University of Singapore","date_posted":"September 06, 2016","last_updated":"September 06, 2016","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"\u00b7       Waste biomass as low cost feedstock\n\n\u00b7       Ability to adsorb molecules larger than what conventional activated carbon can adsorb\n\n\u00b7       High surface area\n\n\u00b7       Highest mesopore volume achieved from biomass waste\n\n\u00b7       Fully mesoporous\n\n\u00b7       Performance:  dye uptake of 880 mg\/g ","type":null,"technical_fields":"Pollution & Waste > Recycling & reuse","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"High Temp Heat Transfer Fluids (250 C - 1000 C) for use in Energy Capture Systems","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"University of Arizona","date_posted":"December 22, 2015","last_updated":"December 22, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1)  Low melting point\n\n\n2) High operating temperature\n\n\n3)  Low vapor pressure\n\n\n4) Little corrosion","type":null,"technical_fields":"Energy > Thermal\nEnergy > Solar","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"High Temperature Soft Ferromagnetic Materials","sector":"Chemicals and Advanced Materials","submitted_by":"Northwestern University","date_posted":"September 15, 2016","last_updated":"September 15, 2016","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"  Strong ferromagnetic  coupling  Stable at high  temperaturesLow coercive field  ","type":null,"technical_fields":"Chemicals & Advanced Materials > Other","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"High Temperature Sulfur Sorbents - Fuel Cells","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"University of Toledo","date_posted":"December 08, 2015","last_updated":"December 08, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"\u00b7Removes sulfur from logistic fuel streams\n\n\n\u00b7Better performance in terms of breakthrough time\n\n\n\u00b7Imparts longevity to reforming catalyst\n\n\n\u00b7Enhances sorption capacity","type":null,"technical_fields":"Energy > Fuel cells","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"High Throughput Filtration of Oil-Containing Wastewater using a Carbon Nanotube-Infused Membrane","sector":"Pollution and Waste","submitted_by":"The Innovation Hub Management Company","date_posted":"April 02, 2015","last_updated":"April 02, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Water","benefits":"The structure of the membrane reduces fouling and increases mechanical strength, thereby increasing filter lifespan and and enabling cheaper wastewater filtration.

Membrane filtration is widely used to separate oil from water due to the high quality of water produced, low chemicals used and low energy consumption; but existing methods are affected by fouling of the filter through build of up organic and inorganic deposits on the membrane, as well as concentration polarisation.

Experimental observations have confirmed an increase in 100% efficiency over plain evaporator tubes at each of the three tiers, indicating a significantly higher overall increase in efficiency for an evaporative system. At the Nano level the entire surface is oxidized to increase the contact angle which has a direct benefit on increasing passive liquid spreading, increases the surface wetting, and reducing the possibility of dry out. At the Micro level the sintered porous wick coating increases surface area and allows for enhancement of heat transfer due to the creation of a three phase contact meniscus increasing the overall evaporative qualities for the system. At the Macro level the porous integral fins enhance evaporation due to the further increased surface area and allows for low pressure drops for liquid flow hence expanding the wetting capabilities for the system. The benefits of this novel design are: a significant reduction in power consumption, reduction of solution requirements, a marginal risk of failure, and thin-film evaporation (key component of the technology) at the three-phase contact meniscus using low-thermal resistance over increased surface wetting. Potential ApplicationsTypical applications for this technology extend to; refrigeration, heating and air conditioning, the organic chemical industry (as column reboilers in (high) vacuum distillation systems), petroleum refinement, product purification, solvent recovery, concentration of solutions and slurries, crystallization, as well as drying and treatment of industrial waste streams. OpportunityThe technology is currently ready for application in particular markets and is undergoing continuous development that will potentially increase overall potential. As such partners are needed immediately to take advantage of this exciting opportunity and quickly address existing markets.

Think about your shower, and the amount of water a small drain hole can remove from a torrent of cascading water from a showerhead - this concept is magnified by the number of drain pipes per unit of area (100 pores\/sq meter) in the Aqueduct assembly, providing an astonishing water displacement rate of 12,557 mm\/hr.\n\nWater from the first large rainfalls are percolated down through the layers of gravel and accumulates there, forming a temporary underground storage reservoir- the water then gradually disperses into the soil over a wide area, settling into a natural ground water reservoir. This process greatly reduces the accumulation of water, saturation and subsequent flooding.\n\nThis ground water can be used for secondary water usage (watering plants, lawns, car wash etc.), and access can be as simple as turning on a faucet on an embankment.\n\nJW Pavement EcoTechnology also can be adapted to underground water catchment containers and serve other creative purposes to conserve and re-use valuable water resources, especially in drought stricken areas.\n\nCarbon Capture & Pollution Reduction:\n\nn a natural habitat, the granularity of the soil, sediment and gravel allows the land surface to inspire and expire as conditions change in the subsurface and atmosphere (e.g. temperature change, air pressure). In a metropolis, miles upon square miles of concrete and pavement stifle this respiration and result in a phenomena known as \u201cHeat Island Effect\u201d, closely related to the Greenhouse effect but occuring in a metropolitan center. This leads to rising temperatures and accumulation of deleterious pollutants in the atmosphere, especially vehicle emissions.\n\nJW Pavement allows this important surface\/subsurface respiration to occur in urban areas through the drainage pipes or \u201cpores\u201d on the JW pavement. At the same time atmospheric vehicle emissions are quickly reduced through this same mechanism. A series of extensive experiments were conducted in concert with the National Taipei University of Technology to measure CO2 levels in an enclosed area covering the JW surface contrasted with a non-JW surface. The results were astonishing and significant.\n\nSustainable Subsurface Eco-MicroWetland:\nThe moist soil\/sediment subsurface layer under JW pavement will thrive with life - it provides a wetland eco-system with important consequences. A study by Liu et al. (2012) and Fan et al. (2013) indicates the existence of meiofauna such as chironomid larvae and desmoscolex and a detection of a considerable amount of microorganisms in the underlying layers.\n\nThis phenomenon suggests that decomposition of grease and organic compounds, fixation of nitrogen for tree roots are underway in the lower layers. Pollutants are also entering the lower layers to be trapped and decomposed as nutrients for bacteria and then flushed with rainwater as harmless by products. The micro wetland acts as a biological filter to clean the urban surface environment. The proliferating tree roots under the pavement also show a sign of a healthy habital environment for surface vegetation.","type":null,"technical_fields":"Building & Construction > Roads","development_stage":"Proven record of commercial use","project_summary":"We have obtained Concours Lapine International Paris Gold Medal Award, International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland, \"Gold Medal\", Pittsburgh international invention Award, and in 2014 was invited by China for the Fujian Provincial Construction Department and Beijing Olympic Park ,etc. \n\nJW\u2019s sponge road construction method also known as \u2018 breathing pavement\u2019, not only can be used in walkways and driveways, but also has the feature to stores water.

Access rate to grid slowly evolved during the past few years, and will hardly cover growing energy needs. \nIn West Africa, most solar equipments are imported from Asia and their quality is often uncertain. Some products that passed Lighting Global Standards Quality Tests appeared in the market a few years ago (d.light, Green Light Planet\u2026), but distributors face difficulties in importing the products and implementing after-sale services. As of today, there is no pico pv solar equipments assembled or produced in West Africa. \nTherefore, LAGAZEL will be the first in the market to offer solutions to manufacture high quality products, in metal, produced locally with tough quality control and efficient after-sale-services. \nLAGAZEL designs and manufactures environment-friendly, reliable and efficient products adapted to developing countries\u2019 needs. At the beginning, two models of KALO solar lanterns are available, from \u20ac20 to \u20ac30. KALO products are affordable and offer the best quality in the market: a metallic and unbreakable hull, up to 48 hours autonomy, 2-year warranty and an efficient after-sale service. Thanks to this free and unlimited solar energy, people living in off-grid rural area are able to study and work later in the evening, can easily charge mobile phone by using solar lamp model with phone charging, and even save money on purchasing oil or batteries for their traditional lighting devices (in Sub-Saharan Africa, the off-grid population spent over $14 billion on lighting in 2014). \n\nOn top of that, LAGAZEL contributes to industrial expansion of developing countries by implementing LAGAZEL facilities-in-a-box (L-BOX) closed to final customers.  With a production capacity of 150 000 to 200 000 lamps per year, a L-BOX facility consists of a production line, training modules for the team, sales-aid tools, and a repairing and dismantling line for end-of-life products. Contrary to most players in the photovoltaic sector that offer poor quality products made in Asia, LAGAZEL business model contributes to create jobs locally, to reduce environmental impact of the logistics chain, while offering a high-quality after-sale service to customers. Through its facilities implemented close to final customers, LAGAZEL is also able to design solutions in response to basic needs of the population and to collect and dismantle end-of-life products.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"LED lamps","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"LEDsafari","date_posted":"July 29, 2016","last_updated":"July 29, 2016","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Solid Fuel, Air","benefits":"LEDsafari aims to provide education on clean energy and sustainability through a unique science and design training centred on creating a solar LED lamp.\nThe lamp is affordable and locally repairable compared to existing solutions in developing countries.\n- The damaged electrical component can easily be replaced.\n- The training provides capacity building, which is important for local innovation.\n- Through lamp making, the students get to experience solar energy, which often remains theoretical.\n- By making and understanding the solar lamp, the students acquire technological ownership.\n- The kit is modular and can be easily extended from 0.5W system to 5W system. \n- The DIY element encourages local entrepreneurship, where people can make lamps which cater to local need with their own design.","type":"Design","technical_fields":"Energy > Solar\nEnergy > Energy efficiency","development_stage":"Proven record of commercial use","project_summary":"There are 1.3 billion people who live without access to electric light (off-grid), a great- er number than when Thomas Edison commercialised the incandescent light bulb in the 1880s.

These off-grid people spend more than USD 30 billion every year on buying kerosene for lighting. In addition, economic, environmental, social and health problems are well documented for the off-grid market.\nWe have developed and validated a unique approach to give a sustainable source of lighting to those without proper access to electricity (off-grid). We teach secondary school students to make their own simple and functional solar LED lamps and for this, we sell a kit, which includes training material for teachers and students, high quality components and access to an online community.\nOn a conservative basis, we are planning to reach a cumulative total of 3 million sec- ondary school students by 2020 in India and Africa. Our social and environmental im- pacts are considerable and we would like to scale our approach globally to maximize these impacts.

Teijin Limited announced today that its Multi-Stage Activated Biological Process, MSABP, system, a core offering of the company's wastewater treatment business, has been adopted for multiple new sewage treatment plants in the Hunnan New District of Shenyang city, China. Shenyang had initially planned to construct a centralized sewage treatment plant in Hunnan New District, which will host the National Games of the People's Republic of China scheduled in 2013. In view of the enormous cost and lack of time to complete construction before the games, however, the city decided to scrap that plan in favor of Teijin's MSABP system for decentralized treatment via multiple, shipping container-size plants. In the future, when the system is eventually replaced with a larger centralized system to accommodate the area's anticipated population growth, it will be possible to relocate the decentralized MSABP plants to other areas of the city.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"MWANGA-BORA (SOLAR LANTERN LAMP)","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"East Africa Climate Innovation Network (EACIN)","date_posted":"November 27, 2013","last_updated":"November 27, 2013","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Electricity","benefits":"Solar panel cells - electricity production - batteries -LED lighting bulbs therefore enabling lighting in electricity -limited settings.","type":"Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Energy > Solar","development_stage":"At usable level","project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Magnesort - Process for the Recycling of Permanant Magnets","sector":"Pollution and Waste","submitted_by":"TechnologieAllianz e.

Mimosa Weed Solar Endeavour is a project undertaking to explore the solar impulse on Mimosa pudica plant for the development of solar cells to produce solar panel\nThe photo electrochemical reaction is the mechanism in this technology. The reaction takes during the day, when the leaves open. Water in the plant is broken down by the absorbed solar radiation into hydrogen and water. In mimosa pudica live plants, photolysis take place. That is, when the electrons leave the chlorophyll, molecules leave behind a \u2018hole\u2019. This electron hole is filled in by water molecule that is oxidized, or loses electrons, as it essentially splits into two oxygen atoms, or protons and an oxygen atom. While harnessing this phenomena, and transforming the science behind this into a usable technology scientific procedure were followed to detect and isolate the black silicon (semiconductor) compound responsible. Calculated amount of the compound was dissolved and made up to a known volume in water solvent. Electrochemical and photolysis take place in the individual cells designed in thin film on a substrate. Water is transparent to visible light. It cannot be decomposed directly, but only by radiation with wavelengths between 300nm and 400nm. Current output in a Mimosa cell current output is Maximum as indicated in the visible\/ultraviolet spectra shown in fig 390nm. The Mimosa solar panel by design is not directly exposed to direct sun rays. Instead, it is shielded for optimum performance according to properties of the semiconductor. This is reminiscence in the live Mimosa pudica plant weed where the leaves sprout out fully, about 180o when covered by taller shrubs in the bush.  \n Mimosa weed renewable energy involves neither emissions nor significant levels of combustion.

For liquid-propellant rockets, the specific impulse should compare favorably with values for the same propellants in larger rockets.","type":null,"technical_fields":"Energy > Energy efficiency","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Mircroscale Ion Wind Engine","sector":"Green Products","submitted_by":"Purdue Research Foundation","date_posted":"November 25, 2013","last_updated":"December 16, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1) Lower implementation costs\n\n\n2) Prevents ion neutralization\n\n\n3) Enhanced force convection cooling of integrated circuit chips\n\n\n4) Ability to cool on-chip hot spots","type":null,"technical_fields":"Other Areas > Other Areas\nGreen Products > Products that save water\/energy","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Mixed-Phase Titanium Dioxide Photocatalyst","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"Northwestern University","date_posted":"November 30, 2015","last_updated":"December 16, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1) Uniform dispersal of thin film with good mechanic strength    \n\n\n2) Increased photoactivity in both oxidation and reduction chemistry    \n\n\n3) Functional under both UV and visible light    \n\n\n4) Scalable for commercial use   ","type":null,"technical_fields":"Energy > Solar","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Mixing Entropy Battery","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"Stanford University","date_posted":"November 14, 2013","last_updated":"December 16, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1) Completely renewable source of energy\n\n\n2) Minimal environmental footprint\n\n\n3) Simple to fabricate\n\n\n4) Reduced cost\n\n\n5) Doesn\u2019t rely on membranes\n\n\n6) Overcomes the challenges of supercapacitor electrodes based on activated carbon","type":null,"technical_fields":"Energy > Energy storage","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Mobile Solar Pump","sector":"Green Products","submitted_by":"Sun City Energy","date_posted":"July 28, 2016","last_updated":"July 28, 2016","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Electricity, Water, Air","benefits":"Small farmers will be able to switch from conventional diesel pumps to solar pumps at a reasonable and competitive price.

Monitoring the quality of water, as well as treated wastewater, necessitates proper analyses by capable laboratories staffed with well trained and competent staff. Numerous areas in South Africa have no established and or accredited laboratories. The consequence is that water quality is either not constantly monitored or that samples need to be sent to other laboratories, adding time delays and raising questions about the chain of custody. Mobile laboratories, capable of water analysis as per South African National Standards (SANS) and regulatory requirements, are the answer to this, creating an alternative for municipalities who cannot immediately invest in infrastructure and resources to fund their own laboratories. These mobile laboratories will not only support municipalities and other organisations that need access to water testing laboratories, but will also assist researchers and decision-makers by providing crucial data on a more consistent basis and from a wider geographic spread. In addition, the labs will help facilitate more and better water quality-related research in remote areas. The mobile laboratories can be quickly transported to towns or areas where they are needed; they can be shared between organisations\/municipalities\/towns; and they can be rapidly moved to outbreak areas. This platform also allows field testing for researchers involved in developing new rapid methods such as diagnostic kits and biosensors which could lead to new products and services for South Africa and globally.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Mobile sized, high speed, low cost, sludge concentration method and device","sector":"Pollution and Waste","submitted_by":"Technoplan Inc.","date_posted":"May 06, 2014","last_updated":"May 06, 2014","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Oil, Electricity, Land, Water","benefits":"The sludge can be continuously thickened at a high speed, and the structure of a device is far simplified and downsized than conventional systems, which saves electricity, land, manpower and time.","type":"Process, Design, Material, Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Pollution & Waste > Waste treatment","development_stage":"Under R & D","project_summary":"Actual experimental devices are in use as of April 2014.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Mobile unit for the desalination of sea water or brackish water by the heat recovered from the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine","sector":"Water","submitted_by":"DAAM association of young inventors","date_posted":"July 14, 2016","last_updated":"July 29, 2016","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Water","benefits":"The invention allows,\nto remedy the lack of fresh water in many countries,\nhelp solve the problems of survival and\nmeet the growing needs of drinking water, or\nthe development of semi-arid continents affected by drought\n\nThe invention falls within the scope of non-conventional water resources (desalination of sea water, demineralization of brackish water, reuse of treated wastewater ...).","type":"Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Water > Water production","development_stage":"Under R & D","project_summary":"The present invention concerns a mobile unit for the desalination of sea water or brackish water, using the heat from the exhaust gases of an internal combustion engine, in particular of a motor vehicle, carrying a device implementing the invention, combining, by means of cogeneration, the transportation and distribution of fresh water with the desalination of sea water or brackish water, or the distillation of water from a well, a lake or a river, or household waste water.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Mobile, biological wastewater treatment plant","sector":"Water","submitted_by":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research","date_posted":"July 19, 2017","last_updated":"July 19, 2017","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Water","benefits":"- High mobility and flexibility of the system\n- Fast set-up and removal, immediately ready for operation\n- No storage space or other permanent space required on-site: economic solution","type":"Device or equipment, Facility","technical_fields":"Pollution & Waste > Bio-remediation\nWater > Water treatment","development_stage":"Proven record of commercial use","project_summary":"Tested under commercial conditions with urban sewage in cooperation with Leipziger Stadtwerke, Germany, a local municipal utility.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Mobiya TS 120S","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"Schneider Electric","date_posted":"October 23, 2015","last_updated":"October 23, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Oil, Electricity","benefits":"1) Energy Efficient Lighting thanks to electronic design, LED technology and Lithium Ferro \n\n2) Phosphate battery\n\n3) Water resistant up to 0,5m depth for one hour\n\n4) Chock Resistant\n\n5) Integrated Mobile phone charger with USB Cable with 5 adapters\n\n6) Up to 48 hours of autonomy with one day of charge\n\n7) User Friendly, Plug and Play product, 7 simple ways to use the lamp","type":"Design, Material, Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Energy > Solar","development_stage":"At usable level","project_summary":"Type of collaboration sought - For sale, Joint venture","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Model for Predicting the Cloud Point of Biodiesels","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"Purdue Research Foundation","date_posted":"March 03, 2017","last_updated":"March 03, 2017","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1.

Rain water recycling: JW pavement obtains ability of rainwater recycling, therefore minimizes disasters caused by flood and drought.\n\n2. Temperature Conditioning: JW pavement regulates surface temperature- warmer in winter, cooler in summer, mitigates urban heat island effect.\n\n3. Cleaning Water and air: JW pavement filters rainwater pollutants as well as captures vehicle-emitted pollutants, including carbon dioxide, thus managing smog issue.\n\nOne of the greatest advantages that JW Pavement EcoTechnology has over Pervious Pavements, is the rate at which water can be removed from the surface. Think about your shower, and the amount of water a small drain hole can remove from a torrent of cascading water from a showerhead - this concept is magnified by the number of drain pipes per unit of area (100 pores\/sq meter) in the Aqueduct assembly, providing an astonishing water displacement rate of 12,557 mm\/hr.\n\nWater from the first large rainfalls are percolated down through the layers of gravel and accumulates there, forming a temporary underground storage reservoir- the water then gradually disperses into the soil over a wide area, settling into a natural ground water reservoir. This process greatly reduces the accumulation of water, saturation and subsequent flooding.\n\nThis ground water can be used for secondary water usage (watering plants, lawns, car wash etc.), and access can be as simple as turning on a faucet on an embankment.\n\nJW Pavement EcoTechnology also can be adapted to underground water catchment containers and serve other creative purposes to conserve and re-use valuable water resources, especially in drought stricken areas.","type":"Device or equipment, Design, Material","technical_fields":"Building & Construction > Roads","development_stage":"Proven record of commercial use","project_summary":"JW Ecological pavement exists more than 10 years. JW is already on ecological road with hundreds of installations, withmaintenance-free performance exceeding 10 years (and annual maintenance fee of about only 5% of that of the traditional pavements). And it helps among others to face floods and droughts problems while improving water resource management, water purification and air pollution.\n\nJW Ecotechnology allows private and city planners to landscape roads, plazas, parks, sidewalks with truly permeable, breathable surfaces that provide a harmonious cohabitation with the earth\u2019s natural subsurface to sustain a living and breathing eco-system.\n\nJW eco-friendly pavement can also cool a hot surface and raise the temperature of a cold one. During the summer months the breathable road\u2019s surface is nearly 20 C lower than nearby asphalt. While the ground surrounding a small breathable road Chen Jui-wen made at a 2008 Beijing Olympics venue was covered with a blanket of snow, the road surface remained clear.\n\nJW Pavement EcoTechnology is new type of Structural Pervious Pavement that answers the call that previous technologies could not, in whole, address - that is, bearing high loads, low maintenance, durability and sustainable subsurface ecohabitat. It has a remarkable feature that allows the surface to literally breath, circulating air\/moisture (evapotranspiration) and moderating temperatures.\n\nIn a natural habitat, the granularity of the soil, sediment and gravel allows the land surface to inspire and expire as conditions change in the subsurface and atmosphere (e.g. temperature change, air pressure). In a metropolis, miles upon square miles of concrete and pavement stifle this respiration and result in a phenomena known as \u201cHeat Island Effect\u201d, closely related to the Greenhouse effect but occuring in a metropolitan center. This leads to rising temperatures and accumulation of deleterious pollutants in the atmosphere, especially vehicle emissions.\n\nJW Pavement allows this important surface\/subsurface respiration to occur in urban areas through the drainage pipes or \u201cpores\u201d on the JW pavement. At the same time atmospheric vehicle emissions are quickly reduced through this same mechanism. A series of extensive experiments were conducted in concert with the National Taipei University of Technology to measure CO2 levels in an enclosed area covering the JW surface contrasted with a non-JW surface. The results were astonishing and significant.\n\nThe data showed that for the JW pavement, after 5 minutes of exhaust emissions, CO2 levels dissipated faster and were more rapidly diluted to normal levels than non-JW pavements by 74%.\n\nAt 0.5m height, the averaged level of CO2 over the JW pavement is about 84% lower than that over the non-JW pavement.\n\nAt 2m height, the averaged level of CO2 over the JW pavement is about 76% lower than that over the non-JW pavement.

The function of these type of features are to prevent the backward movement  while starting on hill ascent. \n       Most of these feature are utilizing power. An engine with  130 HP can consume 10 ml\/sec. So there is a fuel consumption as well as air pollution when we are using the  HSA or HAC. So we need to have a feature  which does not need power.\n\nThe vehicles which are not having these features also consume more fuel as the drivers uses the Half Clutch or Hand Brake method to overcome the rollback while starting on hill ascent.\n\nIn Half Clutch method only a part of the full engine power is used for moving the vehicle\n\nIn Hand Brake method engine power is used for movement of the vehicle and overcoming  part of brake force\n\n\nThe advantages in details\nPower, Pollution and Fuel Consumption \nThis new SHA is not using the power brake or any other mechanism which uses power to hold the vehicle on a hill ascent. \n\nThere is no fuel consumption as the new SHA does not need of power\n\nThere is no air pollution as the new SHA does not need fuel.  \n\nThere is a very little wear and tear for the new SHA, as the system does not use any existing devices, accessories or mechanisms for the producing the designed purpose. \n\nMoreover this new SHA does not have much moving parts which cause wear and tear.\n\nThe new SHA have a delay in activation as well as deactivation. For the present SHA at the time of activation the driver has to keep the brakes pedal pressed till the beep sound is generated to start the system. \n\nSimilarly the new SHA can be deactivated after pressing the accelerator for some time. This cause the delay in starting the vehicle. But the new SHA does not have that delay in activation or deactivation  \n\nThe new SHA have to be activated and deactivated many times in a single ascent if the start and stop situation occurs many times. This is a tedious and time consuming process. \n\nMoreover it may create a panic situation for the driver. The new SHA can be activated one time for many uses in the same ascent.\n\nOperation of the new SHA is very simple and easy, as there is no need to keep the brake pedal pressed or wait for the beep sound. The driver have to just pull a lever like that of the door lock.\n\nThe maintenance is quite easy as there is only two parts and it does not need frequent maintenance\n\nThere are only two parts for this  new SHA compared to the current SHA which uses the existing devices, accessories or mechanisms. \n\nMoreover the components of this new SHA are similar to that of the existing parts of the vehicle and so easy to manufacture\n\nAs the brake system is not used in the new SHA there is no need of brake fluid, brake shoes and other consumables related to the brake system \n\nMoreover any other consumables from other systems  are also not used. So there is no need of any items which needs to replenished.  \n\nThe current HSA has many parts or subsystems whose failure can cause the system to fail, which in turn affects the safety of the passengers as well as the vehicles. The new SHA have only two mechanical parts and so it fails in very rare cases.\n\nShortage or leakage of any consumables in any subsystems or parts can cause a failure of entire system. \n\nEven power failure can cause the system to fail.\n\nThe metallic parts produces the desired function and so no need of any electronic circuits and electric systems, which may become no use if there is a circuit failure.

Firstly, our process reduces the required processing time by 2,000 times. Secondly, our technology reduces the capital cost for the production by 1,000 times. Thirdly, our product is one of the few in the world that can actually sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. \n\nOur first claim to innovation is in terms of reduction in processing time for agriculture use. Currently, there are many processes that convert biomass waste into valuable agricultural commodities. One of the main challenges that all these processes face is that various biomass types in rural farms are not always of satisfactory quality to be economically converted. To convert this biomass waste frequently involves drying, delicate mixing, large storage area, and long turn-over time of as much as 6 months. Our streamlined and carefully designed process will not require any of these demanding steps, and can make high-quality product from organic waste in less than 2 hours, therefore reducing the required processing time by about 2,000 times. \n\nOur second claim to innovation is that our technology drastically reduces the capital cost associated with biomass waste conversion\/recycling, and therefore, lowers the barrier for setting up low-cost, decentralized production sites close to the communities. The main challenge in the world today is that most existing biomass conversion technologies  are often capital-intensive, centralized, and have a minimally economic scale of operation. Therefore in order to operate these technologies cost-effectively, it becomes necessary to ship large amounts of biomass to the reactor. Given biomass is often loose, bulky, and wet, the transportation and processing costs can be overwhelming. As a result, even though biomass waste is readily available in many rural parts of the world, in many remote places it is simply set on fire because there are currently no technologies that can economically transport and process this \u201cremote\u201d biomass into recycled products. We have engineered, in partnership with a scientific team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology a new biomass converter under extreme affordability and simplicity. This technology is so simple that it can be made\/operated anywhere with minimal capital investment of US$20, a 1,000-fold reduction in capital cost. Our key innovation opens the possibility of distributed biomass conversion, which will happen locally in the field\/farms rather than centrally in a capital-intensive facility. This therefore eliminates the expensive transportation and drives the cost of biomass conversion down greatly. Note that this innovation has broad implications beyond merely producing agricultural soil conditioner from biomass waste this innovation is also equally applicable in the low-cost and decentralized conversion of biomass waste into energy.\n\nThirdly, as a side benefit, our soil conditioner based on fortified biochar is carbon negative. As farmers buy our products, they are also sequestering about 1.5 tons per acre of CO2 equivalent into the soil. With increased global warming and greenhouse emissions, there have been various ideas of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Our method involving biochar, historically and currently, remains one of the few commercially proven ways.","type":"Process, Material","technical_fields":"Farming & Forestry > Alternative to chemical pesticides\/insecticides\/fertilizers\nPollution & Waste > Waste avoidance","development_stage":"Proven record of commercial use","project_summary":"Safi Organics is a private limited company that produces a soil conditioner derived from biomass (farm) waste.

This conditioner, which can completely replace commercial fertilizer, helps farmers improve their long-term crop yields by 30% and increase their income by 50%.

Once fully paid, the solar home system unlocks and delivers free electricity for the expected 10-year life of the product. We transform an energy expenditure into an asset purchase. We offer consumers the opportunity for ownership of their energy resource and break their dependence on expensive, unhealthy, and inefficient sources of light and electricity. \n \nTo do this we have invented, built and field-tested the core technology that regulates usage of an electronic device based upon the receipt of payments.

Studies on the effects of the zeolite mass on the removal of manganese showed a high removal efficiency. Leaching tests demonstrated that zeolite removed the toxic elements by encapsulation in its framework via an ion-exchange mechanism.\n \nThe process for producing Zeolite beginning with fly ash includes the formation of an intermediate geopolymer product that converts to zeolite after a period of incubation. The geopolymer product, containing zeolites in formation, can be applied directly to the polluted soil, thus immobilizing toxic heavy metals within the zeolite structure during its growth and formation.\n \nZeolite formation directly in polluted soil represents a useful method to reduce both the availability and the mobility of the toxic elements, ie heavy metals.\n \nExperiments performed with this product both at laboratory and bench scale suggest that zeolite captures heavy metals in its structure while forming, reducing the mobilization of toxic elements.\n \nSEM and EDX spectra of zeolites formed according to the process indicates the presence of lead entrapped into the mineral structure or precipitated onto its surface. BE images - Back-scattered Electron image - show no brightness change to the zeolite surface, suggesting that the lead is not locally concentrated.\n \nStudies performed on solid residues with aggressive acids still show the presence of zeolite, thus documenting that the chemical treatment does not attack the mineral. The chemical solution did not determine any ion-exchange reaction in zeolite, and therefore it did not liberate the metal ions entrapped in its structure. \nOver the last decades, numerous methods have been proposed for geopolymer and zeolite synthesis starting from fly ash. The differences concern the type of alkaline solutions, molarity of alkaline agents, solution\/fly ash activation ratio, temperature, reaction time, pressure, and incubation type. In all cases, the formation of zeolite X under 60 C is not documented.\n \nThe patented process presented here solves the problems of the low yields in synthesis and of the high costs of processes for synthesizing zeolite X known in the art.\n \nThese problems are solved with a synthesis process that utilizes sea water and low incubation temperatures, making the production of zeolite X cheaper than with other methods. The use of sea water allows, in the incubation temperature range of 35-40 C, zeolite X formation with yields up to 8 times greater compared to the same process using distilled or tap water.","type":"Process","technical_fields":"Pollution & Waste > Water\nPollution & Waste > Recycling & reuse\nPollution & Waste > Land","development_stage":"At usable level","project_summary":"Experiments have been performed both at laboratory and bench scales with the product synthethized in a small pilot manufacturing scale.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Soil degradation\/ soil erosion and soil fertility depletion","sector":"Water","submitted_by":"African Agricultural Technology Foundation","date_posted":"February 26, 2016","last_updated":"February 26, 2016","meta_category":"need","resources_saved":null,"benefits":null,"type":null,"technical_fields":"Water > Other","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Soil improvement techniques","sector":"Farming and Forestry","submitted_by":"Ministry of Economy","date_posted":"December 30, 2015","last_updated":"December 30, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"Production of organic vegetables, herbs and flower seeds for both organic and conventional markets.

Finally, replacing kerosene lamps with solar light bulbs enhances families\u2019 long-term spending power. Kerosene lamps burn 30 liters of kerosene per year, costing users about $1.50 per liter (Mills, 2010). This aggregate running cost of a kerosene lamp, $45 per year, is a huge expense for the Energy Poor, who have very limited means.

Calcium carbonate can be calcined on site to produce quicklime and magnesium hydroxide can be recycled within the process to reduce chemical costs.","meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"Voltage-Gated Bipolar Transistor for Power Switching Applications","sector":"Energy","submitted_by":"Rutgers University","date_posted":"December 07, 2015","last_updated":"December 07, 2015","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":null,"benefits":"1) Bi-polar Transistor (VGBT) power switching device offering all the desired characteristics of an IGBT without the three fundamental problems mentioned above. \n\n\n2) Advantageous SiC power devices  properties including wider band gap, larger critical electric field, higher thermal conductivity to operate at higher temperatures and voltages, in addition to higher power and current density over the pure Si devices. \n\n\n3) Allows the SiC discrete devices to operate at much higher voltage, reduce conduction and switching losses, offer higher efficiencies in electronic systems.","type":null,"technical_fields":"Energy > Other","development_stage":null,"project_summary":null,"meta_org":"wipo_green"},{"title":"WADI The Indicator for Solar Water Disinfection","sector":"Water","submitted_by":"HELIOZ GmbH","date_posted":"July 24, 2017","last_updated":"July 24, 2017","meta_category":"offer","resources_saved":"Water","benefits":"Prevention of waterborne diseases\nLess firewoood or gas used for water disinfection\nLess CO2 emission","type":"Process, Device or equipment","technical_fields":"Water > Water treatment","development_stage":"Proven record of commercial use","project_summary":"WADI is a solar powered UV measurement device that visualizes the process of solar water disinfection (SODIS) in PET bottles.

To reduce the waiting time for hot water, most houses are equipped with a hot water looping and a circulation pump, a huge hidden wasting of energy which is deprecated to heat the walls of the house in summer as well as in winter, stupidly wasting up to 20% of the full house energy consumption. The installation of a water-saving faucet aerator reduces the flow of water by 50% but it therefore double the waiting time for hot water, which is often unacceptable. I designed a faucet that has the same functions as a traditional water mixer but that has an additional output orifice and a thermostatic element to detect the presence of the hot water.

Using the Spinel system helps clothes to get sloshed in two directions , both in a circular motion and a center-oriented course perpendicular to axis. It can help provide faster sloshing that can give better cleaning.\nA larger drum surface for drying process also lets clothes get dried faster and more effectively . We also have faster water drainage that means the metallic parts of the drum remain less in contact with water that can increase their effective lifetime. On the other hand , draining faster can help prevent forming of mildew, bacteria, and mold that normally cause the bad smell in the washing machines.\nSuch a configuration also lets clothes lie so that more space remains between layers of clothes during the washing process that helps better penetration of detergent agent and better water movement. That improves the washing cycle.\nBecause the clothes move more toward a central circle , and because of less moment of inertia , less torque is needed to accelerate the drum , this will also save power.
