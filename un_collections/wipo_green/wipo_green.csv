Jet Aerator promotes active agitation by a strong whirlpool within the tank, and the special nozzles in Jet Aerator maximizes the contact area between the influent air and the fluid in the ATAD tank to enhance the efficiency of oxygen transfer. In addition, by generating fine bubbles with their contact area per size being large, it can increase the frequency of contact of fluids. In particular, in the case of Jet Aerator, it is an essential device in improving the rate of digestion of aerobic microbes to them air supply can be a key issue.  Unlike the previous air suppliers, which are configured to have a shape of straight line so that they may be much restrained from generating whirlpool, this technology is completely rounded as well as fan-shaped. So, the shape of nozzles are well prepared to generate whirlpool while energy consumption is low and the rate of air supply to aerobic microbes is enhanced.

(KOTEC11) Facilities for the reuse of water and wastewater and the phosphorous removal (Up-flow filtering device),Pollution and Waste,KOTEC,"April 15, 2015","April 17, 2015",proposal,"Electricity, Water","The upflow water treatment apparatus injects coagulant directly into the pipes, so that a mixing tank and a flocculation tank are not needed. In this respect, it is simpler than the existing water treatment apparatuses and can save the installation space. Also, retention time is no more than 10 minutes, so it is possible to treat water quickly. Moreover, the efficiency of SS and total phosphorus removal is relatively high and can decrease the cost for repair and maintenance greatly.

In terms of economic feasibility, the upflow water treatment apparatus by the technology requires about 92,778 thousand KRW per year including the costs of electricity, chemical agents and filter media supplement, etc. on the basis of 17 thousand tons of treated water per day. However, in the case of the existing disc-filtration apparatus, the cost of filter media supplements is so high that it requires about 231,823 thousand KRW per year. In the case of multi-layer filtration apparatus, about 146,340 thousand KRW is needed per year. Hence, it can be said that the upflow water treatment device by this technology is superior to those devices by the conventional technology in terms of economic feasibility.

In the environmental terms, the technology can reduce the consumption of chemical agents greatly, and the amount of backwash water is nothing but 3% of that of influent water (other technologies require about 5 %). Thus, the discharge of sludge is low as compared to the previous technologies, so it is advantageous in that it can reduce the overload on the environment.",Device or equipment,Pollution & Waste > Waste treatment,Proven record of commercial use,"A upflow water treatment apparatuses in the technology have been installed and in normal operation in the wastewater treatment plant in Keum-chon, Paju (with a capacity of 17,000 tons per day) and the wastewater treatment plant in Mun-san, Paju (with a capacity of 9,500 tons per day). If this technology is introduced, the efficiency of SS and total phosphorus removal is high (0.2 ppm for SS and 0.3 mg/L for total phosphorus) in the technological terms. So, it is appropriate to the standard of influent water, and it is unnecessary to stop operation for cleaning a filtration tank. Also, since it is possible to realize the completely automatic operation, it is advantageous in that the effective management of wastewater treatment facilities is possible. "

  production process for PLA : One of the challenges for biodegradable 

  replacement polymers has been the lower cost of commodity polymers like 

  polyethylene, polypropylene and PVC. Technologies that contribute to reducing 

  the cost of PLA will increase its competitiveness with petroleum-derived 

  polymers. This process eliminates the need for enantioselective 

  processes.

  significantly higher meting point than PLA produced by the standard process. 

  This higher melting temperature allows the materials to be used for high 

  temperature applications. 

  Environmentally advantageous: The technology enables 

  broader use of PLA as both green replacements for petroleum-derived polymers 

  and bioresorbable polymers used for implanted medical 

  devices.

It could be used to wirelessly feed low consumption electronics for the Internet of things.","Process, Material",Energy > Waste to energy,Under R & D,"Energy harvesting is the process by which energy is
taken from the environment and transformed to provide
power for electronics. Specifically, thermo electrics can play
a crucial role in future developments of alternative sources
of energy. Unfortunately, present thermoelectric engines have
low efficiency. Therefore, an important task in condensed
matter physics is to find new ways to harvest ambient
thermal energy, particularly at the smallest length scales
where electronics operate.

The invented system is really a simple one, which exploits certain properties of quantum dots to harvest heat.
Despite this simplicity, the power it could generate is still larger than any other nano engine that has been considered until now.

The engines would be microscopic in size, and have no moving parts. Each would only produce a tiny amount of power a millionth or less of what a light bulb uses. But by combining millions of the
engines in a layered structure, Jordan says a device that was a
square inch in area could produce about a watt of power for
every one degree difference in temperature. Enough of them
could make a notable difference in the energy consumption of
a computer."

Avosolar,Energy,Avonax Group,"July 18, 2016","July 20, 2016",proposal,"Electricity, Other","Avosolar solar cells systems derive clean, pure energy from the sun. Installing solar panels on user’s homes, schools, libraries, hospitals help combat greenhouse gas emissions, reduce deforestation and reduces people  dependence on fossil fuel and woods as source of energy. Traditional electricity is sourced from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. When fossil fuels are burned to create energy, they emit toxic gases that are the primary cause of pollution and global warming.  Not only are fossil fuels bad for the environment, they're a finite resource.  

 Lack of access to electricity and modern energy sources profoundly limits                economic development, constrains people’s life chances and traps millions in  extreme poverty.  Around 88% of the DRCongo’s population, about 65 million people, have no access to electricity at all. Lack of electricity in the democratic republic of Congo remains one of  the biggest barriers to the development and prosperity, and continues to trap millions of people  in extreme poverty.  As a result, quality of life is severely diminished, resulting in needless  deaths and stifled economic growth.    
In 2015, of the 75 million people living in DRCongo, nearly 65 million people in DRCongo heat their homes and cook using traditional fuels like wood and dung. Inhalation of the smoke and fumes produced from burning traditional fuels results in over two million deaths per year, due  to diseases related smoke. mainly among women and children. That’s more deaths than from malaria and HIV/AIDS combined.       Additionally, 3% of forests and biodiversity are destroyed due to deforestation caused by  people that use wood as source of energy.  With a third of all health centres and  primary schools lacking any access to electricity, that means that ten million students and 20 million patients are left being educated and receiving health care from places that have no power. Nearly 60% of refrigerators used in health clinics in DRC have unreliable electricity, compromising the safe storage of      vaccines and medicines.      Hospitals are sometimes forced to operate with no lighting or power for equipment, putting people’s lives at serious risk. Children without domestic lighting struggle to do their homework in the evening, which negatively impacts their education and hampers their ability to fulfill their potential. To provide people with innovative energy source, we have develop a solution to overcome this challenge. Avosolar an innovative efficient and low cost solar cells. We have developed Avosolar on the  principle that sunlight can be concentrated in Nanowires due to a resonance effect. This effect can result in producing low cost and more efficient solar cells, allowing more than 98% of the energy from the sun to be converted to electricity and that will cost 10 times less expensive than traditional solar cells. In fact, Due to some unique physical light absorption properties of nanowires, the limit of how much energy we can utilize from the sun's rays is higher than previous believed. These results demonstrate the great      potential ofdevelopment of nanowire-based solar cells.

Beyond the sea - Kite auxiliary propulsion,Transportation,Beyond the sea,"October 19, 2015","October 19, 2015",proposal,Oil,"Nowadays, maritime transportation represents 90 % of the global trade and the amount of goods actually loaded aboard ships have increased considerably. The current world fleet is constituted of 100 000 commercial ships and 1 000 000 fishing ships. 
Moreover, shipping is estimated to have emitted 1 046 million tonnes of CO2 in 2007, which corresponds to 3.3 % of the global emissions during 2007 according to the Second IMO GHG Study. 

Kite operation on ships has many advantages:
 By taking advantage of wind, which is a 100 % renewable energy, the ship’s energetic needs are reduced. Depending on the required efficiency, kite propulsion can relieve the conventional diesel engine. According to the report of the United Nations “Review of Maritime Transportation”, a kite auxiliary propulsion system can save up to 20 % fuel. For instance, a container ship fuel consumption is about 150 000 litres per day. Using a kite as auxiliary propulsion system, the fuel saving could amount to 30 000 litres per day (i.e. about $ 20 000 per day).
 Reduction of CO2 can be achieved through greater fuel efficiency or reduced fuel oil consumption. In this field, kite operation would reduce the greenhouse gas emission by 20 %. Taking into account the fact that current world fleet is constituted of 100 000 commercial ships and 1 000 000 fishing ships, kite propulsion would have a major impact on the environment.
 Kite operation on ship has advantages in term of security. In fact, in case of damage, a kite system can be used to have a better visibility. Furthermore, a kite can be used as a propulsion system to reach a port autonomously.
 Compared to a conventional sail rig, one of the main advantages is that it does not generate any capsizing moment. This is a significant aspect in the case of a container ship. 
 A kite is easily adaptable to commercial ships, fishing ships, military ships or yachts. Indeed, it does not need a spacious infrastructure on the ship deck. 

Using a 320m² kite, fuel economy would reach 25% on the North Atlantic route (corresponding to 134 tonnes of CO2), which is a major benefit, since maritime transportation represents 90 % of the global trade.","System or software, Device or equipment","Transportation > Maritime/Waterways

For example, butanol production processes typically also generate low levels of acetone and ethanol. The proposed BC or BAC process would separate these chemicals into individual columns based on adsorption and temperature. 


The cyanofactory process being developed to produce third generation biofuels from CO2 results in volatilization of water and the specific chemical in the gas phase that passes through the photobioreactor. The BC or BAC columns would adsorb the water and chemical from the gas phase, and following desorption and condensation, the concentration of the chemical should be sufficient to allow low cost phase separation.",,Energy > Biomass/Bioenergy,,

They employed a two-step process that uses readily available lignin extraction products, vanillin or ferulic acid, as a starting material for the production of poly (dihydroferulic acid) (PHFA). In one embodiment of the invention, the researchers derived acetyldihydroferulic acid  from lignin and then combined this monomer with a catalyst to initiate polymerization (i.e. plastic formation). The starting materials are byproducts of paper production and the polymer decomposition product is dihydroferulic acid, a common plant metabolite.

In human waste disposal pit latrines and septic tanks are used and in very desperate cases the bush. All the above mentioned methods release methane gas to the atmosphere contributing to global warming.  In kitchen waste disposal, dumping in the streets and delivery to a central garbage dump methods are used.  When garbage is left to or in the open, it released methane gas to the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer thus creating greenhouse effect. Garbage also attracts pests and scavengers infested with parasites which spread infectious deceases. The technology is a two chamber system which processes human waste in one chamber and food waste in the other chamber. It is a biological system where the organic solids are broken down to liquid effluent by the anaerobic bacteria and requires very little maintenance. The anaerobic digestion destroys the harmful bacteria making the effluent add to soil fertility.  The digestion takes place in completely sealed chambers where all methane gas produced is harnessed and piped to the kitchen where it is used for cooking thus mitigating climate change.

Biphasic extract comprising an aqueous phase and an oil phase,Pollution and Waste,Individual inventor,"January 16, 2015","March 13, 2015",proposal,"Water, Land","The invention also provides a unique extraction process from WET biomass of micro-organisms. The process does not require the use of volatile organic solvents (detrimental for the health and the environment). Moreover the process operates at mild temperature conditions and without the need of costly and hard to mantain equipment, thus overcoming the currently used high pressure extraction processes. 

The market potential of the product and process is above 1550K USD/year considering a conservative 10% of the total US market share in the nutraceutical and cosmetaceutical areas by 2015-2016. 

The biphasic extract is distinct from currently sold products in the fact that it contains all the lipid material originally in the microalgae biomass: both apolar lipids (e.g. triglycerides, free fatty acids) and polar lipids (e.g. glycolipids, phospholipids) of the omega3-fatty acids series (such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) 

Thereby the biphasic composition provides outstanding nutraceutical values over the currently existing extracts that are mostly limited to the apolar fractions and are therefore less rich in the PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The outcome of the process is a biphasic extract that can easily be processed to omega3-PUFA oil in high yield if required. 

Furthermore, the unique extraction process from WET biomass of micro-organisms does not require the use of volatile organic solvents that are detrimental for the health and the environment. The invention is on the contrary based on natural extractants obtainable from agriculture waste (such as plant derived fermetation alcohols) and on biological processes.

Continuous Process for the Production of Biodiesel using Tin Catalyst,Energy,Oregon Health & Science University,"December 07, 2015","December 07, 2015",proposal,,"1. The tin catalyst is not consumed, nor does it degrade during the reaction thereby reducing chemical costs. Additionally, the catalyst does not contaminate the product streams thus making the esterification products easier and less expensive to polish.


2. These tin catalyzed processes do not produce soap because sodium methoxide is not used in the reaction; therefore the glycerin byproduct is not contaminated and is of a higher quality.


3. These reactions are tolerant of free fatty acids and moisture in feedstocks thus allowing the use of a wide range of less expensive oils and alcohols.


4. A continuous flow process design reduces the reactor footprint and produces products of consistent quality. The reactor size is quite small – a 50 gallon reactor volume will sustain a one million gallon-per-year biodiesel production facility.


5. These novel processes are compatible not only with methanol but also ethanol. Although the methanol-triglyceride reactions are faster (~40%), by taking advantage of bio-ethanol rather than petroleum derived methanol it is possible to create a truly carbon-neutral bio-fuel.


6. Six potential feedstocks have been tested, including yellow grease and canola,camelina, jatropha, soy bean, and castor oils. The majority of these oils were used directly from the expeller press with no additional refining. All tested feedstocks achieved better than 90% conversion in six minutes, or less, under similar reactor conditions using ethanol.",,Energy > Biomass/Bioenergy,,

Cupric Oxide Recovery using EOCOR™ from Cupric Chloride Etchant Waste,Pollution and Waste,Swing Corporation,"April 11, 2016","May 19, 2016",proposal,,"EOCOR is the on-site recycling technology which can produce the CuO from cupric chloride etchant waste. The etchant waster discharged from the print circuit board factory is treated with EOCOR process. The product CuO can be used as a raw material of plating.
EOCOR process can save the copper resources and decrease of waste from PCB factories.","Process, Design, Device or equipment, Facility",Pollution & Waste > Waste treatment,Proven record of commercial use,"1. Outline
Cupric chloride etchant waste is discharged from the print circuit board manufacturers. The etchant waste is characterized by a very low pH and high cupric ion and chloride ion concentrations.
The EOCOR Process is an on-site recycling technology of the cupric etchant waste. And the product of EOCOR Process is cupric oxide which can be used as a raw material of plating process.
For on-site recycling technologies, one of the biggest challenges is to avoid chloride contamination. The copper plating process requires precise control of the chloride concentration, which affects the performance of copper plating. Thus, chloride should be removed from recycled copper, even though cupric oxide etchant waste contains a much higher concentration of chloride ion, as mentioned above. For this reason, on-site copper recycling technologies to produce recycled copper with a low content ratio of chloride have become highly desirable.
The EOCOR Process can produce the low chloride content CuO because the etchant waste is added stepwisely to the NaOH solution. And according to the optimization of the reaction conditions, we confirmed the produced CuO can be used as a raw material of plating process.

2. The process of EOCOR reaction
a  For CuO recovery, the etchant waste and H2O2 solution were mixed and stirred (Process A). 
b  The mixture of etchant waste and H2O2 solution was added to NaOH solution, stirring continuously (Process B). 
c  After the stirring of the NaOH solution, we repeated stepwise the mixing and addition process till the terminal pH was reached. 
d  The slurry of CuO product was washed with deionized water several times and dried afterwards, and the properties of the dried CuO were described.

3. The optimization of the reaction conditions
We optimized the reaction condition on laboratory experiment. As the result, the final pH of the reaction and the temperature of NaOH solution affect to the chloride content of produced CuO.

4. The pilot scale experiment
Based on the optimized conditions established by the lab-scale experiments, the on-site trial production of CuO from real cupric chloride etchant waste was carried out at a PCB factory. The operation time per batch was about two hours. The throughput of the trial plant was 55 L of etchant waste per batch. We ran the pilot plant for 14 batches and washed part of the CuO slurry. We then successfully obtained about 20 kg-dry weight of refined CuO powder. The chloride content of the refined CuO powder was measured to be around about 80 mg-Cl/kg-CuO. The removal ratio of copper from the etchant waste was almost 100%, since the soluble cupric content of the supernatant was below 2 mg/L. 

This fact clearly shows that our proposed recycling technology is applicable to actual etchant waste treatment and that the optimized conditions are efficient for actual use.

5. The first practical plant
Based on the pilot trial, we constructed the first practical plant in Vietnam. The throughput of the plant was 10 t/d of etchant waste. The chloride content of the recovered CuO was 85 mg-Cl/kg-CuO, and the plant produced stable CuO for eight months."

DEVICE AND METHOD FOR AIR CONDITIONING,Green Products,Solarinvent srl,"July 15, 2016","July 15, 2016",proposal,Electricity,"Freescoo is high performing heat driven cooling solution: Energy Efficiency Ratio (ratio of cooling energy provided to electricity required) reached so far is 13vs 3of conventional air conditioning units, 8 of high efficient air conditioning units and about 8 of the most efficient available heat driven cooling devices. The minimum EER to become viable for heat driven cooling is considered to be 10. Primary energy consumption is 8 times lower than a generic conventional air conditioning unit. 
Freescoo is highly compact, modular and standardized solution: the target air conditioning unit with 2.5kW cooling power and 4.7kW heating power, dimensioned for a residential unit from 30 to 40 m2 in Southern Europe. Thanks to its modularity, freescoo can reach a wide range of applications for air conditioning in residential and small tertiary buildings (offices, commercial units). The product is standardized, compact and plug and play solution (error free installation and high cost reduction potential) . 
Freescoo can easily be integrated with solar energy: the electricity needed to drive the system is very low (200W), while benchmark conventional electricity driven air conditioning unit with the same cooling power absorbs 1.2 kW, hence the system can also work as completely stand-alone system without electricity grid connection using PV. Moreover, the use of low temperature heat for the regeneration cycle (55 Celsius degree) allows an efficient integration with flat plate solar collectors. 
Freescoo is environmentally friendly: no use of refrigerant fluids (used in conventional compression air conditioning units), no use of ammonia or lithium bromide (used in absorption heat driven chillers). LCA showed environmental impact of only 6 percent than benchmark solution2. 
Freescoo stores heat in the form of dry silica gel, allowing to keep working for 3-5 hours in dehumidification mode without heat supply and solar radiation. 
Freescoo is at least 60 percent cheaper (1500 -2000 €per kW vs 3800€ per kW) compared to Exhaust Air Heat Pump (EAHP), the only alternative solutions providing complete air conditioning solution in one device: cooling, dehumidification, heating and ventilation with heat recovery in the conditioned space.",Device or equipment,Green Products > Products that save water/energy,At usable level,"So far, main milestones achieved have been:
- Intellectual property and trademark protection: patents covering freescoo technology have almost completed the path for final registration in EU, US and Japan; freescoo trademark was registered,
- Technology validation: technology has been successfully tested in relevant environment and validated by scientific partners ENEA and University of Palermo, further tests of building integrated freescoo is planned in 2017 in 6 demo buildings in Italy and Cyprus in the framework of H2020 demo project Zero Plus project.
- Image building: the experimental results have been presented at the most important international events related to solar cooling in the last 3 years, leading to recognition of freescoo as one of the most promising solutions by the expert group on Solar Heating and Cooling (SHC) Programme of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Easy Go Trailer (EGT),Transportation,Power Products LLC,"October 29, 2015","November 08, 2015",proposal,"Oil, Natural gas, Electricity, Air","Class-8 tractors are setup to operate for the weight range they will be pulling which sets fuel economy limitations. Operation of a tractor with a trailer modified with the EGT system will allow the fuel economy to increase above traditional fully loaded ratings because the EGT reduces the loading effect on the drivetrain of the tractor. With modifications or changes to the tractor’s engine to match the new load requirements for the EGT will allow fuel economy of the tractor to increase even higher.

An unmodified tractor used to tow class-8 trailers are setup to operate against the maximum loading effect of the combination of the tractor and trailer, and its cargo, to achieve best fuel economy with a full load. Class-8 tractors ‘without a trailer attached’ routinely operate near an average of 11.5 to 14.5 mpg. Fuel economy for the tractor with a fully loaded trailer will average 5.6 to 7.2 mpg. Operation of the tractor with a trailer modified with an EGT retrofit will allow the fuel economy to increase up to 11 to 13 mpg pulling a fully loaded trailer.

With introduction of the EGT it will allow OEMs to develop new systems to match safety requirements for the new loading effect offered by the EGT into the transportation industry.  Significant advances in fuel economy across the transportation industry can easily exceed the ‘retrofit fuel economy’ and achieve 12 to 15 mpg and higher.

Drawings illustrated in figures 1 and 2 demonstrate two basic functions for the EGT assembly. Figure 1 shows the rest position with no force applied to the top input pivot, item 1. The lever arm is mounted about the axle to allow the lever arm to rotate as required and this connection also serves as the fulcrum pivot item 2.  Below the fulcrum is the output pivot item 3, where the weight of the trailer and its load is attached to allow the primary weight to be below the fulcrum (axle). With the primary weight below the axle and no force applied at the top input pivot, weight at the bottom pivot will force the lever arm assembly to have a vertical alignment.

Figure 2 shows the lever arm offset to be 10 degrees away from the rest position as a result of the tractor applying an increasing force to initialize operation of the EGT. To understand operation of the concept it is important to realize the input pivot is being pulled forward by the effort of the tractor supplying force. As you learn the system you will realize the weight of the trailer is 62,500 pounds and will have substantial inertia. As the lever arm begins to rotate about the fulcrum pivot half of the weight, 31,250 pounds, will be at the rear of the trailer attached to the bottom pivot developing potential energy based on the angle of displacement about the fulcrum.

Illustration used in figure 2 indicates an offset angle of 10 degrees to explain operation of the concept whereas the actual operational offset angle for flat operation is very small and would not show displacement in this type drawing. As a natural course of events an offset positions that is higher will generate higher potential energy and will create increasing levels of acceleration.","Process, Design, Material, Device or equipment",Transportation > Road,Under R & D,"In reality the axles and wheels will move first because the weight of the axles and wheels make up only 3.2% of the total weight of the trailer which has a weight of 62,500 pounds. When force is applied to the EGT lever assembly/s it will have the weight of the trailer attached to the bottom pivots while the axles are attached to the second pivot positions above the output pivots. The top pivot locations are at the 5:1 ratio input position that controls operation of the EGT.

With an input force creating an action of pulling the lever arm/s forward, that action will generate a reaction at the bottom pivot of attempting to rotate the trailer’s weight about the axle pivots. Any rotation about the axle pivots will develop a level of potential energy and in the initial 10 degrees the response will have a near flat horizontal force acting against the axle pivots. When the potential energy level reaches and then exceeds the rolling resistance against the wheels, motion can be established. This will happen when the level of potential energy develops from transitioning a portion of the trailers weight that matches, exceeds the loading effect, and then is maintained to control the motion of the trailer.

This technology is the next step toward electrification of the class-8 group of vehicles.  Reality is this system will crossover into any weight class to provide the same advantages to improve fuel economy and/or eliminate the use of fuel all together.

Traditional highway operation occurs between 0 and 6 percent of grade and as the below chart indicates the actual incline in degrees is less than the ‘percent of grade’. As the above spreadsheet indicates operation on a ‘1 degree’ incline will require 1,396 pounds of force to match the load of the vehicle. Operation using the EGT will provide the same operation using a force of 279.2 pounds thus providing a reduction in the standard power requirements by 1,116.8 pounds."

In the equipment segment for autonomous power generation and desalination of seawater does not exist a technical solution that is both acceptable from an economic and environmental point of view. Wind turbines and solar panels cannot yet solve this problem, and this problem is particularly acute on islands and coastal areas.
At present there are numerous attempts to find other opportunity. And one of the promising directions is the transformation of wave energy. However, the existing technologies did not give the expected result because they tried to transform wave energy into the oscillatory movement of the working mechanisms. This is no efficient, owing to the fact that there is loss of energy to overcome the alternating loads arising due to the negative influence of the force of inertia.

We have patented our own conception and our main advantage is the original dynamic scheme: our technology enables you to convert wave energy into rotation of working mechanism immediately. Entire energy of the waves is aimed at rotation of the device, consequently all design is fly-wheel and the force of inertia has a positive effect - https://youtu.be/8K4Yc_cUQZo

Operation principle of the power plant
Altohes technology has high internal consumption status.

The power plant uses 4, 3 of the energy produced for its own use.

Gross output power of  4 MW is used for pumps, consumes 3 MW energy and a net energy of 1 MW is for external usage.

The first 2, 3 minutes of the power plant motion is from the network or from the generator  and helps to fill the  pool and pipes with water.

When  production of alternative energy starts, the  electronic system automatically cuts the  external energy and the  4 3 of the energy produces is put into the continuous energy production cycle.


Efficiency Technical Description Cod T.A.T 970 1000 
4.000 kW, 1MW gross 1.000 kw net production.

For the production of 4 MW, 15.840 tone of water and 3.000 kW energy is used per hour. At a height of 50 mt cm, a 5 kg pressure free fall is applied allowing the flow downwards.

5 kg pressure is applied to the wings of the 4350 cm2 turbine which makes a total of 21.750 kg pressure, when the wing has obtained (4.450 kW) 213.150 Nm (200 rpm) pushing power it moves at a rate of 1mt/second.  When it has lost 10% efficiency it still remains with 191.835 Nm Nm power and with this power 4,000 kW electricity is produced.

High performance evaporator tube design providing increased efficiency,Energy,"University of Nevada, Reno","May 24, 2016","May 24, 2016",proposal,,"The key aspect of this technology is the utilization of a multi-tiered effect to dramatically reduce the consumption of input (energy and material) while increasing the output. Experimental observations have confirmed an increase in 100% efficiency over plain evaporator tubes at each of the three tiers, indicating a significantly higher overall increase in efficiency for an evaporative system. At the Nano level the entire surface is oxidized to increase the contact angle which has a direct benefit on increasing passive liquid spreading, increases the surface wetting, and reducing the possibility of dry out. At the Micro level the sintered porous wick coating increases surface area and allows for enhancement of heat transfer due to the creation of a three phase contact meniscus increasing the overall evaporative qualities for the system. At the Macro level the porous integral fins enhance evaporation due to the further increased surface area and allows for low pressure drops for liquid flow hence expanding the wetting capabilities for the system. The benefits of this novel design are: a significant reduction in power consumption, reduction of solution requirements, a marginal risk of failure, and thin-film evaporation (key component of the technology) at the three-phase contact meniscus using low-thermal resistance over increased surface wetting. Potential ApplicationsTypical applications for this technology extend to; refrigeration, heating and air conditioning, the organic chemical industry (as column reboilers in (high) vacuum distillation systems), petroleum refinement, product purification, solvent recovery, concentration of solutions and slurries, crystallization, as well as drying and treatment of industrial waste streams.

HLS treats municipal wastewater in less water resources and produces the treated water that is suitable for recycling water or irrigation. 
 
2. Save Electricity Required for Water Treatment 
HLS can reduce electricity required for municipal wastewater treatment from 0.6kwh/m3 to 0.2kwh/m3. This means, The HLS system for treatment of 10,000 ton of municipal wastewater per a day can save electricity of 1.46 million kwh per a year.

The HLS system for treatment of 10,000 ton of municipal wastewater per a day can cut 146 million CO2kg of greenhouse gas emitted per a year (converted with electricity production from coal). 
 
4. Reduce Eutrophication in Closed Water Systems such as Lakes 
HLS can reduce 90% of nitrogen contained municipal wastewater and, therefore, prevent eutrophication in closed water systems such as lakes, international rivers and inner bays. 
 
5.Reduce an Amount of Surplus Sludge Generated with recycling and reusing 
With low F/M ratio, HLS can reduce the amount of surplus sludge and microorganisms generated with processes of wastewater treatment and even the sludge and microorganisms can be reused for agricultural lands as well-organic manure. 
 
6. No Chemicals 
HLS does not require any chemicals such as flocculant that some competitive wastewater treatment technologies require for the wastewater treatment. HLS, therefore, does not require any facilities for chemicals such as chemical feeding, agglomeration, and treatment of agglomerated sludge. 
 
7. Best for societies under the Clean Development Mechanism (""CDM"") 
HLS is the best solution for low social cost and energy-saving societies maintained by CDM with total control of functions of no-manned wastewater treatment facilities located broadly.

Also, they often cannot be used in an aqueous environment, because of their insolubility. In comparison the key features of the hybrid photocatalysts, that are the subject of the presented offer, are
as follows:
1) they can be used in an aqueous environment
2) they are based on non-toxic natural minerals (kaolinite, bentonite, mica, talc, which are layered nanoclays)
3) at the same time they are capable of purifying water in a physical absorption process as well as in a photodegradation process, therefore they combine the advantages of the photochemical and the adsorption method of water purification
4) they self-separate from water in the sedimentation process, so that they can be easly removed by filtration or decantation
5) their photochemical components may be chromophores of natural origin (e.g. porphyrin derivatives)

Hybrid photocatalysts based on layered nanoclays can become an attractive alternative method of water purification, particulary suitable for industrial plants using water in their technological process, e.g. in power, steel, chemical, pharmaceutial or foodprocessing plants. Moreover, they can be tailored for specific applications (pollutants).",,Farming & Forestry > Alternative irrigation,Under R & D,"The application of the hybrid photocatalysts and the method of obtaining them are subject of a patent application.

JW Eco-Technology,Building and Construction,"Ding Tai Co.,Ltd","August 05, 2016","August 05, 2016",proposal,"Water, Air, Land, Other","Flood Prevention & Water Management: 

One of the greatest advantages that JW Pavement EcoTechnology has over Pervious Pavements, is the rate at which water can be removed from the surface. Think about your shower, and the amount of water a small drain hole can remove from a torrent of cascading water from a showerhead - this concept is magnified by the number of drain pipes per unit of area (100 pores/sq meter) in the Aqueduct assembly, providing an astonishing water displacement rate of 12,557 mm/hr.

Water from the first large rainfalls are percolated down through the layers of gravel and accumulates there, forming a temporary underground storage reservoir- the water then gradually disperses into the soil over a wide area, settling into a natural ground water reservoir. This process greatly reduces the accumulation of water, saturation and subsequent flooding.

This ground water can be used for secondary water usage (watering plants, lawns, car wash etc.), and access can be as simple as turning on a faucet on an embankment.

JW Pavement EcoTechnology also can be adapted to underground water catchment containers and serve other creative purposes to conserve and re-use valuable water resources, especially in drought stricken areas.

Carbon Capture & Pollution Reduction:

n a natural habitat, the granularity of the soil, sediment and gravel allows the land surface to inspire and expire as conditions change in the subsurface and atmosphere (e.g. temperature change, air pressure). In a metropolis, miles upon square miles of concrete and pavement stifle this respiration and result in a phenomena known as “Heat Island Effect”, closely related to the Greenhouse effect but occuring in a metropolitan center. This leads to rising temperatures and accumulation of deleterious pollutants in the atmosphere, especially vehicle emissions.

JW Pavement allows this important surface/subsurface respiration to occur in urban areas through the drainage pipes or “pores” on the JW pavement. At the same time atmospheric vehicle emissions are quickly reduced through this same mechanism. A series of extensive experiments were conducted in concert with the National Taipei University of Technology to measure CO2 levels in an enclosed area covering the JW surface contrasted with a non-JW surface. The results were astonishing and significant.

Sustainable Subsurface Eco-MicroWetland:
The moist soil/sediment subsurface layer under JW pavement will thrive with life - it provides a wetland eco-system with important consequences. A study by Liu et al. (2012) and Fan et al. (2013) indicates the existence of meiofauna such as chironomid larvae and desmoscolex and a detection of a considerable amount of microorganisms in the underlying layers.

This phenomenon suggests that decomposition of grease and organic compounds, fixation of nitrogen for tree roots are underway in the lower layers. Pollutants are also entering the lower layers to be trapped and decomposed as nutrients for bacteria and then flushed with rainwater as harmless by products. The micro wetland acts as a biological filter to clean the urban surface environment. The proliferating tree roots under the pavement also show a sign of a healthy habital environment for surface vegetation.",,Building & Construction > Roads,Proven record of commercial use,"We have obtained Concours Lapine International Paris Gold Medal Award, International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland, ""Gold Medal"", Pittsburgh international invention Award, and in 2014 was invited by China for the Fujian Provincial Construction Department and Beijing Olympic Park ,etc. 

JW’s sponge road construction method also known as ‘ breathing pavement’, not only can be used in walkways and driveways, but also has the feature to stores water.  Our method is capable of forming underground wetlands to solve flood and drought, heat island and  environmental pollution. At present, more than fifty countries worldwide make authorization requests for our intellectual property rights."

- 640,000 tons of CO2 emissions saved 
- 6 million people access to renewable energy for lighting and for basic energy needs (considering 6 people in average in an African family)
- € 100 million saved by families on energy-related purchases
- 150 jobs created (15 jobs in average per workshop).","Process, Device or equipment",Energy > Solar,At usable level,"In Africa, 650 million people do not have access to electricity. 90% of African families use poor-quality, costly and harmful equipments for lighting (oil lamps, electric torches). Access rate to grid slowly evolved during the past few years, and will hardly cover growing energy needs. 
In West Africa, most solar equipments are imported from Asia and their quality is often uncertain. Some products that passed Lighting Global Standards Quality Tests appeared in the market a few years ago (d.light, Green Light Planet…), but distributors face difficulties in importing the products and implementing after-sale services. As of today, there is no pico pv solar equipments assembled or produced in West Africa. 
Therefore, LAGAZEL will be the first in the market to offer solutions to manufacture high quality products, in metal, produced locally with tough quality control and efficient after-sale-services. 
LAGAZEL designs and manufactures environment-friendly, reliable and efficient products adapted to developing countries’ needs. At the beginning, two models of KALO solar lanterns are available, from €20 to €30. KALO products are affordable and offer the best quality in the market: a metallic and unbreakable hull, up to 48 hours autonomy, 2-year warranty and an efficient after-sale service. Thanks to this free and unlimited solar energy, people living in off-grid rural area are able to study and work later in the evening, can easily charge mobile phone by using solar lamp model with phone charging, and even save money on purchasing oil or batteries for their traditional lighting devices (in Sub-Saharan Africa, the off-grid population spent over $14 billion on lighting in 2014). 

On top of that, LAGAZEL contributes to industrial expansion of developing countries by implementing LAGAZEL facilities-in-a-box (L-BOX) closed to final customers.  With a production capacity of 150 000 to 200 000 lamps per year, a L-BOX facility consists of a production line, training modules for the team, sales-aid tools, and a repairing and dismantling line for end-of-life products. Contrary to most players in the photovoltaic sector that offer poor quality products made in Asia, LAGAZEL business model contributes to create jobs locally, to reduce environmental impact of the logistics chain, while offering a high-quality after-sale service to customers. Through its facilities implemented close to final customers, LAGAZEL is also able to design solutions in response to basic needs of the population and to collect and dismantle end-of-life products."

Energy > Energy efficiency",Proven record of commercial use,"There are 1.3 billion people who live without access to electric light (off-grid), a great- er number than when Thomas Edison commercialised the incandescent light bulb in the 1880s. The kerosene-fuelled lighting they use is much less efficient than even the most inefficient incandescent lamp, is a large emitter of CO2 and is very costly. These off-grid people spend more than USD 30 billion every year on buying kerosene for lighting. In addition, economic, environmental, social and health problems are well documented for the off-grid market.
We have developed and validated a unique approach to give a sustainable source of lighting to those without proper access to electricity (off-grid). We teach secondary school students to make their own simple and functional solar LED lamps and for this, we sell a kit, which includes training material for teachers and students, high quality components and access to an online community.
On a conservative basis, we are planning to reach a cumulative total of 3 million sec- ondary school students by 2020 in India and Africa. Our social and environmental im- pacts are considerable and we would like to scale our approach globally to maximize these impacts. We would need an investment of USD 1 million in our second year of operation."

Lignocellulosic Biomass Pretreatment Using Gaseous Ammonia,Energy,Michigan State University,"November 30, 2015","November 30, 2015",proposal,,"(1) Faster pretreatment time: Using the GAP process, it is possible to rapidly reach the desired pretreatment temperature of 100-150 degrees Celsius instantly, thereby reducing the biomass residence time to 5-15 minutes in total. Ammonia in the delivery vessel is preheated and ensures condensation of hot ammonia gas on the raw biomass, causing an instantan rise in temperature.


(2) Limited or no ammonia recovery: Use of hot gaseous ammonia along with hot steam and inert gas/air limits the need to recover ammonia as is required in other pretreatment processes. In competing processes, the ammonia recovery step is expensive in terms of time and energy costs.


(3) Less temperature degradation of raw biomass: Current biomass pretreatments, such as dilute acid pretreatments, tend to “over degrade” the raw biomass due to higher temperatures.


(4) Pretreatment residence time reduction: Competing processes can require long biomass residence time (hours to weeks), which are expensive and inconvenient to scale.


(5) No impact on downstream processing: GAP does not inhibit downstream processing of the raw biomass hence there is no need to wash the biomass to remove inhibitors.

Teijin Limited announced today that its Multi-Stage Activated Biological Process, MSABP, system, a core offering of the company's wastewater treatment business, has been adopted for multiple new sewage treatment plants in the Hunnan New District of Shenyang city, China. Shenyang had initially planned to construct a centralized sewage treatment plant in Hunnan New District, which will host the National Games of the People's Republic of China scheduled in 2013. In view of the enormous cost and lack of time to complete construction before the games, however, the city decided to scrap that plan in favor of Teijin's MSABP system for decentralized treatment via multiple, shipping container-size plants. In the future, when the system is eventually replaced with a larger centralized system to accommodate the area's anticipated population growth, it will be possible to relocate the decentralized MSABP plants to other areas of the city."

The innovation will have long term beneficial effect of making available to the users a cheap, easy to manipulate source of solar electric energy to drive many of the everyday use appliances. Its simplicity, elasticity of usage and cost effectiveness is driving force to sustain its long term benefit. It uses the abundant solar radiation to generate electricity which can benefit areas currently not serviced by the National grid. 
On social impact, the innovation will go a long way to meet the electrical power needs of the people both in supply and cost. 85% of Africans live in the rural areas where there are high demands for energy, lighting, operating radio, television and communication gadgets, example mobile phones. It has now opened a new window for our yeaning youths seeking employment. Youths are now mobilized in the farm to cultivate the mimosa plant weed and also get trained to participate in assembling of the solar panel
The Mimosa solar initiative is projected as one of the promising alternatives to clean energy.
We are going to benefit as developing nations from huge harvest of Mimosa weed, traditionally thrown away as noxious plant weed during farm land clearing. 
It is now converted to useful renewable solar energy raw material. 
The Mimosa solar technology has now opened a new window to gainfully engage our yeaning youths seeking employment. 
The project is green in that water is principally used to perform the extraction and isolation of the active black silicon from the Mimosa pudica plant weed. The sustainable chemical is the black silicon non-obnoxious sustained through mass cultivation.
It uses the improved technologies. The thin film/nano technology is now applied to cut down the amount of black silicon used and save costs and material.
 The thin film technology applied in making individual cells has demonstrated improved solar sensitivity. 

It has eliminated totally the release of carbon monoxide and other obnoxious gases during conversion of silica to silicon in raw material preparation. 
The raw material in this case is mimosa pudica leaves harvested through cutting new leaves sprout to maintain the resources.
The growing the plant will also serve to remove carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas from the environment)
It is suitable for use in developing countries.
This is indigenous technology designed in line with the semiconductor properties of the raw material.
It provides a platform to harness the abundant solar radiation in developing nations especially in Africa.
 It is suitable for the developing in that the interface challenges encountered in the conventional is eliminated.",,Green Products > Products that avoid toxic or other emissions,At usable level,"Research on Mimosa pudica plant weed is an initiative conceptualized to harness the hidden potentials in Mimosa plant. Mimosa Weed Solar Endeavour is a project undertaking to explore the solar impulse on Mimosa pudica plant for the development of solar cells to produce solar panel
The photo electrochemical reaction is the mechanism in this technology. The reaction takes during the day, when the leaves open. Water in the plant is broken down by the absorbed solar radiation into hydrogen and water. In mimosa pudica live plants, photolysis take place. That is, when the electrons leave the chlorophyll, molecules leave behind a ‘hole’. This electron hole is filled in by water molecule that is oxidized, or loses electrons, as it essentially splits into two oxygen atoms, or protons and an oxygen atom. While harnessing this phenomena, and transforming the science behind this into a usable technology scientific procedure were followed to detect and isolate the black silicon (semiconductor) compound responsible. Calculated amount of the compound was dissolved and made up to a known volume in water solvent. Electrochemical and photolysis take place in the individual cells designed in thin film on a substrate. Water is transparent to visible light. It cannot be decomposed directly, but only by radiation with wavelengths between 300nm and 400nm. Current output in a Mimosa cell current output is Maximum as indicated in the visible/ultraviolet spectra shown in fig 390nm. The Mimosa solar panel by design is not directly exposed to direct sun rays. Instead, it is shielded for optimum performance according to properties of the semiconductor. This is reminiscence in the live Mimosa pudica plant weed where the leaves sprout out fully, about 180o when covered by taller shrubs in the bush.  
 Mimosa weed renewable energy involves neither emissions nor significant levels of combustion. The innovative exploration of the electrical potential of mimosa plant for solar cell production is possible and presents a novel way of making green electric power available."

Monitoring the quality of water, as well as treated wastewater, necessitates proper analyses by capable laboratories staffed with well trained and competent staff. Numerous areas in South Africa have no established and or accredited laboratories. The consequence is that water quality is either not constantly monitored or that samples need to be sent to other laboratories, adding time delays and raising questions about the chain of custody. Mobile laboratories, capable of water analysis as per South African National Standards (SANS) and regulatory requirements, are the answer to this, creating an alternative for municipalities who cannot immediately invest in infrastructure and resources to fund their own laboratories. These mobile laboratories will not only support municipalities and other organisations that need access to water testing laboratories, but will also assist researchers and decision-makers by providing crucial data on a more consistent basis and from a wider geographic spread. In addition, the labs will help facilitate more and better water quality-related research in remote areas. The mobile laboratories can be quickly transported to towns or areas where they are needed; they can be shared between organisations/municipalities/towns; and they can be rapidly moved to outbreak areas.

Performance of microbial compositions and activities of JW ecological pavements,Building and Construction,"Ding Tai Co.,Ltd","July 18, 2016","August 05, 2016",proposal,"Land, Other, Air, Water","JW pavement is capable of tackling three devils by:

1. Rain water recycling: JW pavement obtains ability of rainwater recycling, therefore minimizes disasters caused by flood and drought.

2. Temperature Conditioning: JW pavement regulates surface temperature- warmer in winter, cooler in summer, mitigates urban heat island effect.

3. Cleaning Water and air: JW pavement filters rainwater pollutants as well as captures vehicle-emitted pollutants, including carbon dioxide, thus managing smog issue.

One of the greatest advantages that JW Pavement EcoTechnology has over Pervious Pavements, is the rate at which water can be removed from the surface. Think about your shower, and the amount of water a small drain hole can remove from a torrent of cascading water from a showerhead - this concept is magnified by the number of drain pipes per unit of area (100 pores/sq meter) in the Aqueduct assembly, providing an astonishing water displacement rate of 12,557 mm/hr.

Water from the first large rainfalls are percolated down through the layers of gravel and accumulates there, forming a temporary underground storage reservoir- the water then gradually disperses into the soil over a wide area, settling into a natural ground water reservoir. This process greatly reduces the accumulation of water, saturation and subsequent flooding.

This ground water can be used for secondary water usage (watering plants, lawns, car wash etc.), and access can be as simple as turning on a faucet on an embankment.

JW Pavement EcoTechnology also can be adapted to underground water catchment containers and serve other creative purposes to conserve and re-use valuable water resources, especially in drought stricken areas.","Device or equipment, Design, Material",Building & Construction > Roads,Proven record of commercial use,"JW Ecological pavement exists more than 10 years. JW is already on ecological road with hundreds of installations, withmaintenance-free performance exceeding 10 years (and annual maintenance fee of about only 5% of that of the traditional pavements). And it helps among others to face floods and droughts problems while improving water resource management, water purification and air pollution.

JW Ecotechnology allows private and city planners to landscape roads, plazas, parks, sidewalks with truly permeable, breathable surfaces that provide a harmonious cohabitation with the earth’s natural subsurface to sustain a living and breathing eco-system.

JW eco-friendly pavement can also cool a hot surface and raise the temperature of a cold one. During the summer months the breathable road’s surface is nearly 20 C lower than nearby asphalt. While the ground surrounding a small breathable road Chen Jui-wen made at a 2008 Beijing Olympics venue was covered with a blanket of snow, the road surface remained clear.

JW Pavement EcoTechnology is new type of Structural Pervious Pavement that answers the call that previous technologies could not, in whole, address - that is, bearing high loads, low maintenance, durability and sustainable subsurface ecohabitat. It has a remarkable feature that allows the surface to literally breath, circulating air/moisture (evapotranspiration) and moderating temperatures.

In a natural habitat, the granularity of the soil, sediment and gravel allows the land surface to inspire and expire as conditions change in the subsurface and atmosphere (e.g. temperature change, air pressure). In a metropolis, miles upon square miles of concrete and pavement stifle this respiration and result in a phenomena known as “Heat Island Effect”, closely related to the Greenhouse effect but occuring in a metropolitan center. This leads to rising temperatures and accumulation of deleterious pollutants in the atmosphere, especially vehicle emissions.

JW Pavement allows this important surface/subsurface respiration to occur in urban areas through the drainage pipes or “pores” on the JW pavement. At the same time atmospheric vehicle emissions are quickly reduced through this same mechanism. A series of extensive experiments were conducted in concert with the National Taipei University of Technology to measure CO2 levels in an enclosed area covering the JW surface contrasted with a non-JW surface. The results were astonishing and significant.

The data showed that for the JW pavement, after 5 minutes of exhaust emissions, CO2 levels dissipated faster and were more rapidly diluted to normal levels than non-JW pavements by 74%.

At 0.5m height, the averaged level of CO2 over the JW pavement is about 84% lower than that over the non-JW pavement.

At 2m height, the averaged level of CO2 over the JW pavement is about 76% lower than that over the non-JW pavement. "

In conventional, or centralized, generation of electricity, there are relatively few, large generating plants. These plants, typically coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, or natural gas, supply electricity first to transmission systems, which consist primarily of relatively high voltage power lines.

The CBC system can be carried out in rural areas as well as in cities with a tractor. The CBC system does not need a distribution system or pipelines to transport fuel into power sources.
The CBC energy source system is regional dependent so if a disaster occurred in one region, the other will not be affected. The waste material needed for the CBC system is regional which will not be in crisis of shortcoming or transportation The CBC know how is localized therefore will not be in a crisis of handling and transportation

This initial stage was approached to farmers and merchants through practical field demonstrations at the lowest levels of village production.
This was because; the industry was suffering from insufficient and irregular supply of roots to the factories. The enterprise encouraged research work with the object of obtaining a maximum yield of roots per hectare. Experiments was conducted in various parts of the Lamwo district for the improvement of cassava production and the breeding of new varieties with continuous testing and selection for high yields and suitability to local conditions.  FAO is congratulated for the process of selecting high yield varieties suitable for local condition. In this case therefore, FAO introduced Nasser 13 and 14 varieties because it is high yielding and disease resistance.
The enterprise organized and encouraged formation of groups of cassava growers in each sub-counties to encourage production, make possible financial and technical assistance, and help coordinate the supply of roots to the industry.
Processing and marketing
At this stage, competitions are being sponsored by the enterprise with a prize for the highest producer of cassava tubers, this fostered interest in the scheme.
The enterprise also set up improved machinery to obtain better products. A pilot plant was established in Paloga sub-county, Lamwo District which is one of a high cassava-growing sub-counties as centre for the development of the industry, for demonstration of modern processing equipment and for the training of personnel.
7 personnel were recruited and stationed in the cassava-processing areas.
1 inspector with a diploma in Agricultural engineering specialized in processing with a good general education and practical background and with Administrative experience. He supervises workers at the industry and in the village demonstration farm.
The enterprise has board members that comprise of owners of the industry, representatives of farmers and representatives of merchants and related industries. The board meets regularly to ensure a continuation of useful contacts and act in an advisory capacity to the industrial progress. The board also handles problems of production and marketing of cassava products, open new markets and regulate prices of various products, maintain quality standards, promote research and the development of new products."

In short it can be termed as SUMU

Currently many automobiles manufactures are adding a feature named as Hill Start Assist(HSA), Hill Hold, Hill Ascent Control(HAC) in their automobiles. The function of these type of features are to prevent the backward movement  while starting on hill ascent. 
       Most of these feature are utilizing power. An engine with  130 HP can consume 10 ml/sec. So there is a fuel consumption as well as air pollution when we are using the  HSA or HAC. So we need to have a feature  which does not need power.

The vehicles which are not having these features also consume more fuel as the drivers uses the Half Clutch or Hand Brake method to overcome the rollback while starting on hill ascent.

In Half Clutch method only a part of the full engine power is used for moving the vehicle

In Hand Brake method engine power is used for movement of the vehicle and overcoming  part of brake force


The advantages in details
Power, Pollution and Fuel Consumption 
This new SHA is not using the power brake or any other mechanism which uses power to hold the vehicle on a hill ascent. 

There is no fuel consumption as the new SHA does not need of power

There is no air pollution as the new SHA does not need fuel.  

There is a very little wear and tear for the new SHA, as the system does not use any existing devices, accessories or mechanisms for the producing the designed purpose. 

Moreover this new SHA does not have much moving parts which cause wear and tear.

The new SHA have a delay in activation as well as deactivation. For the present SHA at the time of activation the driver has to keep the brakes pedal pressed till the beep sound is generated to start the system. 

Similarly the new SHA can be deactivated after pressing the accelerator for some time. This cause the delay in starting the vehicle. But the new SHA does not have that delay in activation or deactivation  

The new SHA have to be activated and deactivated many times in a single ascent if the start and stop situation occurs many times. This is a tedious and time consuming process. 

Moreover it may create a panic situation for the driver. The new SHA can be activated one time for many uses in the same ascent.

Operation of the new SHA is very simple and easy, as there is no need to keep the brake pedal pressed or wait for the beep sound. The driver have to just pull a lever like that of the door lock.

The maintenance is quite easy as there is only two parts and it does not need frequent maintenance

There are only two parts for this  new SHA compared to the current SHA which uses the existing devices, accessories or mechanisms. 

Moreover the components of this new SHA are similar to that of the existing parts of the vehicle and so easy to manufacture

As the brake system is not used in the new SHA there is no need of brake fluid, brake shoes and other consumables related to the brake system 

Moreover any other consumables from other systems  are also not used. So there is no need of any items which needs to replenished.  

The current HSA has many parts or subsystems whose failure can cause the system to fail, which in turn affects the safety of the passengers as well as the vehicles. The new SHA have only two mechanical parts and so it fails in very rare cases.

Shortage or leakage of any consumables in any subsystems or parts can cause a failure of entire system. 

Even power failure can cause the system to fail.

The metallic parts produces the desired function and so no need of any electronic circuits and electric systems, which may become no use if there is a circuit failure. The same reason applies for he software programs  also as there is no control module

As the new SHA have only metallic parts, the new SHA gives better  safety of passengers and t"

Safi Organics,Pollution and Waste,Safi Organics Ltd.,"July 28, 2016","July 28, 2016",proposal,"Water, Land, Air","Our project is innovative in three major ways compared to current alternatives. Firstly, our process reduces the required processing time by 2,000 times. Secondly, our technology reduces the capital cost for the production by 1,000 times. Thirdly, our product is one of the few in the world that can actually sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. 

Our first claim to innovation is in terms of reduction in processing time for agriculture use. Currently, there are many processes that convert biomass waste into valuable agricultural commodities. One of the main challenges that all these processes face is that various biomass types in rural farms are not always of satisfactory quality to be economically converted. To convert this biomass waste frequently involves drying, delicate mixing, large storage area, and long turn-over time of as much as 6 months. Our streamlined and carefully designed process will not require any of these demanding steps, and can make high-quality product from organic waste in less than 2 hours, therefore reducing the required processing time by about 2,000 times. 

Our second claim to innovation is that our technology drastically reduces the capital cost associated with biomass waste conversion/recycling, and therefore, lowers the barrier for setting up low-cost, decentralized production sites close to the communities. The main challenge in the world today is that most existing biomass conversion technologies  are often capital-intensive, centralized, and have a minimally economic scale of operation. Therefore in order to operate these technologies cost-effectively, it becomes necessary to ship large amounts of biomass to the reactor. Given biomass is often loose, bulky, and wet, the transportation and processing costs can be overwhelming. As a result, even though biomass waste is readily available in many rural parts of the world, in many remote places it is simply set on fire because there are currently no technologies that can economically transport and process this “remote” biomass into recycled products. We have engineered, in partnership with a scientific team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology a new biomass converter under extreme affordability and simplicity. This technology is so simple that it can be made/operated anywhere with minimal capital investment of US$20, a 1,000-fold reduction in capital cost. Our key innovation opens the possibility of distributed biomass conversion, which will happen locally in the field/farms rather than centrally in a capital-intensive facility. This therefore eliminates the expensive transportation and drives the cost of biomass conversion down greatly. Note that this innovation has broad implications beyond merely producing agricultural soil conditioner from biomass waste this innovation is also equally applicable in the low-cost and decentralized conversion of biomass waste into energy.

Thirdly, as a side benefit, our soil conditioner based on fortified biochar is carbon negative. As farmers buy our products, they are also sequestering about 1.5 tons per acre of CO2 equivalent into the soil. With increased global warming and greenhouse emissions, there have been various ideas of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Our method involving biochar, historically and currently, remains one of the few commercially proven ways.","Process, Material","Farming & Forestry > Alternative to chemical pesticides/insecticides/fertilizers

This conditioner, which can completely replace commercial fertilizer, helps farmers improve their long-term crop yields by 30% and increase their income by 50%. In addition, this product actively sequesters 1.5 tons/acre of CO2 equivalent into the soil per planting season."

Secure prepaid payment platform for clean energy,Energy,"Simpa Networks, Inc.","May 08, 2012","May 08, 2012",proposal,,"Simpa has initially introduced its “pay-as-you-go” pricing to household energy systems. Users pre-pay based on actual usage and each payment adds up towards the total purchase price of the solar home system. Consumers can send payments using a mobile phone. Once fully paid, the solar home system unlocks and delivers free electricity for the expected 10-year life of the product. We transform an energy expenditure into an asset purchase. We offer consumers the opportunity for ownership of their energy resource and break their dependence on expensive, unhealthy, and inefficient sources of light and electricity. 
 
To do this we have invented, built and field-tested the core technology that regulates usage of an electronic device based upon the receipt of payments. Specifically, we are introducing our patent pending Progressive Purchase™ technology – a combination of product-embedded hardware plus cloud-based software that enables a consumer to purchase a solar home system at minimal upfront cost and then to make a series of small payments over time – using a mobile phone – to complete the purchase of their system. 
 
Our novel Progressive Purchase™ model delivers on our vision of “radical affordability” – defined as affordability across three axes:  the initial purchase price; the total cost of ownership; and the flexibility of expenditures over time. 
 
Progressive Purchase 
 
“Progressive Purchase” is a new pricing model that shares some characteristics of the familiar “prepaid”, “pay as you go”, and “installment plan” pricing models. Under Progressive Purchase™, the consumer makes a series of payments, each of which unlocks the solar home system for a paid amount of energy consumption (Kwh).  Once the prepaid consumption is exhausted, the solar home system is temporarily disabled until another payment is made.  Once the consumer has fully paid the total purchase price of the product, full functionality is restored and the product is permanently unlocked. 
 
The Progressive Purchase™ pricing model is enabled by the Simpa Regulator, a tamper-proof, system-integrated microcontroller and user interface that regulates the function of our solar home systems based on proof of payments, and the Simpa Revenue Management System, a centralized software solution in the “cloud”, accessible via SMS gateway and over the internet, for payment processing and accounts settlement.

Soil and water remediation by immobilizing heavy metals with zeolites synthesized from fly ash,Pollution and Waste,Techitra,"October 14, 2013","October 14, 2013",proposal,"Land, Water","The zeolite product has been tested for its ability to remove heavy metals from polluted aqueous solutions. Studies on the effects of the zeolite mass on the removal of manganese showed a high removal efficiency. Leaching tests demonstrated that zeolite removed the toxic elements by encapsulation in its framework via an ion-exchange mechanism.
 
The process for producing Zeolite beginning with fly ash includes the formation of an intermediate geopolymer product that converts to zeolite after a period of incubation. The geopolymer product, containing zeolites in formation, can be applied directly to the polluted soil, thus immobilizing toxic heavy metals within the zeolite structure during its growth and formation.
 
Zeolite formation directly in polluted soil represents a useful method to reduce both the availability and the mobility of the toxic elements, ie heavy metals.
 
Experiments performed with this product both at laboratory and bench scale suggest that zeolite captures heavy metals in its structure while forming, reducing the mobilization of toxic elements.
 
SEM and EDX spectra of zeolites formed according to the process indicates the presence of lead entrapped into the mineral structure or precipitated onto its surface. BE images - Back-scattered Electron image - show no brightness change to the zeolite surface, suggesting that the lead is not locally concentrated.
 
Studies performed on solid residues with aggressive acids still show the presence of zeolite, thus documenting that the chemical treatment does not attack the mineral. The chemical solution did not determine any ion-exchange reaction in zeolite, and therefore it did not liberate the metal ions entrapped in its structure. 
Over the last decades, numerous methods have been proposed for geopolymer and zeolite synthesis starting from fly ash. The differences concern the type of alkaline solutions, molarity of alkaline agents, solution/fly ash activation ratio, temperature, reaction time, pressure, and incubation type. In all cases, the formation of zeolite X under 60 C is not documented.
 
The patented process presented here solves the problems of the low yields in synthesis and of the high costs of processes for synthesizing zeolite X known in the art.
 
These problems are solved with a synthesis process that utilizes sea water and low incubation temperatures, making the production of zeolite X cheaper than with other methods. The use of sea water allows, in the incubation temperature range of 35-40 C, zeolite X formation with yields up to 8 times greater compared to the same process using distilled or tap water.",Process,"Pollution & Waste > Water

too. Unlike kerosene lamps, which emit black carbon and carbon dioxide, solar
light bulbs do not emit anything. Solar light bulbs do not require an unsustainable energy source for power. Indeed, these products exemplify the goals of sustainable development because the only input required for a solar bulb to generate light is sun exposure – a resource that is plentiful in many regions populated by the Energy Poor. Finally, replacing kerosene lamps with solar light bulbs enhances families’ long-term spending power. Kerosene lamps burn 30 liters of kerosene per year, costing users about $1.50 per liter (Mills, 2010). This aggregate running cost of a kerosene lamp, $45 per year, is a huge expense for the Energy Poor, who have very limited means. By displacing one kerosene lamp with a solar light bulb, the expense of acquiring the solar light ASET is a capital cost, but does not have the running cost (the constant need to refill with kerosene) as does a kerosene lamp.

Nokero’s rechargeable batteries last at least a 3 years before they require replacement. Accordingly, this allows for up to 20 percent of an individual’s income to be available for other purposes, such as agriculture investments,

First step: identifying the aquatic areas (renewable aquifers)
Step 2: Create a channel and underground passage collection using the common pattern for creating Iranian aqueducts.
Now, it is possible to use these waters to inject into the aquifer and store water in the ground by installing a water storage tank on the mother's well (the main well connected to the Aqkan) by directing flood waters into the water storage.
Also, by expanding the water supply structure, gradually use this ancient and modern structure instead of structures such as the dam for storing water.
To collect and direct surface water and flood water, special canals can be used in the city as well as the design of portable water storage facilities.
It is also possible to design a system for stormy times that urge urban melting machines to collect fluent water from the city and the streets. In this way, surface waters are collected in cities through the design of smart proprietary channels, as well as through human and technological forces and transferred to water storage facilities.
On the other hand, portable water storage can be used at regular intervals, and each city and district in the city benefit from a safe and optimal supply of water. Storm water is stored in these places and used in critical situations and crisis management.

2) The uniformity by which nanoporous GDLs can be constructed according to the present invention now allows for more accurate simulation modeling, and testing, which can greatly reduce development costs of new electrochemical and gas diffusion technologies, such as, for example, fuel cells, and biomedical devices.


3) The novel methods of the present invention provide for controlling pore size, pore shape and pore distribution of over the design, which allow for a straight or independent (i.e., non- overlapping) pore configuration in the micro/nanoporous gas diffusion media of the invention. This overcomes one other notable problem of the currently available carbon fiber GDLs and their production, which is variability in efficiency due to their random and unpredictable pore size and distribution.

Virtual Energy Storage that Adjusts Energy Supply to Real Time Demand,Energy,University of Florida,"September 29, 2016","September 29, 2016",proposal,,"Advantages

Eliminates need for added generators or batteries, decreasing costs while increasing accuracy

Mitigates high frequency ramps in power from wind or solar generation, overcoming a challenge shared by grid operators all over the world

System allows grid operator to install increasing amounts of renewable energy, resolving the problems faced by high amplitude ramps in power output from renewable generation

Enables high levels of renewable energy, producing monetary benefit for both utility company and consumer

Technology

By enabling multiple loads to turn on or off in response to a regulation signal, researchers have created a means for adjusting demand to more closely match supply at any given time. This gives grid operators a system capable of harnessing the flexibility of individual loads and then using the aggregate flexibility of these loads to regulate the power grid.  Loads may have discrete, finite states of power or on/off type loads or may have continuously variable operating states. This power consumption component achieves control in the aggregate by having multiple loads at numerous customer premises respond in a probabilistic way to a regulation signal. A controller programmed to respond to the regulation signal for each load allows loads in the aggregate to be turned on or off at any time to more closely match power consumption to available power supply.  Grid operators can broadcast a regulation signal to the aggregate in the same way that they engage generators in AGC or battery operators today.",,Energy > Other,,

The VitaSOFT process for treating AMD integrates four biological processes with various chemical processes in order to treat acidic sulphate and metal containing wastewaters, achieving a high water quality of potable standard. Sufficient alkalinity is produced in the initial biological sulphate reducing step to neutralise the acidity of the AMD and to precipitate the dissolved metals as metal sulphides and carbonates, thereby eliminating the need to use a high density sludge neutralisation process. This further reduces the volume of solid waste produced. In addition, valuable by-products are produced such as elemental sulphur, calcium carbonate pellets, and magnesium hydroxide. Calcium carbonate can be calcined on site to produce quicklime and magnesium hydroxide can be recycled within the process to reduce chemical costs."

WATER-SAVING MIXER TAP,Water,Waudoit,"December 14, 2015","December 17, 2015",proposal,"Oil, Electricity, Water","The challenge that was addressed is to reduce the waiting time for hot water to the strict minimum without wasting any water and any energy at all. To reduce the waiting time for hot water, most houses are equipped with a hot water looping and a circulation pump, a huge hidden wasting of energy which is deprecated to heat the walls of the house in summer as well as in winter, stupidly wasting up to 20% of the full house energy consumption. The installation of a water-saving faucet aerator reduces the flow of water by 50% but it therefore double the waiting time for hot water, which is often unacceptable. I designed a faucet that has the same functions as a traditional water mixer but that has an additional output orifice and a thermostatic element to detect the presence of the hot water. The tap for the shower will even allow you to get in the shower before opening the tap without risking to receive a single drop of cold water.","Design, Material",Water > Water efficiency,At usable level,"Some prototypes have been operating for 4 years and saves 10 gal. of water/day/family.

Using the Spinel system helps clothes to get sloshed in two directions , both in a circular motion and a center-oriented course perpendicular to axis. It can help provide faster sloshing that can give better cleaning.
A larger drum surface for drying process also lets clothes get dried faster and more effectively . We also have faster water drainage that means the metallic parts of the drum remain less in contact with water that can increase their effective lifetime. On the other hand , draining faster can help prevent forming of mildew, bacteria, and mold that normally cause the bad smell in the washing machines.
Such a configuration also lets clothes lie so that more space remains between layers of clothes during the washing process that helps better penetration of detergent agent and better water movement. That improves the washing cycle.
Because the clothes move more toward a central circle , and because of less moment of inertia , less torque is needed to accelerate the drum , this will also save power. And in this configuration , the shocks can get absorbed better , so it can help create less vibration and noise.","Design, Device or equipment",Green Products > Products that save water/energy,Under R & D,"The mathematical model and the proof it will save water is ready, the engineering considerations that help create less vibration and noise is reviewd.

Dynamic transmission scheduling and receive-based soft clustering via data summarization concepts of TRACE make it a highly energy efficient MAC protocol. Evenly distributed energy dissipation by coordinator switching and automatic coordinator backup features of TRACE guarantee the network to be functional independent of individual node failures. Information summarization prior to data transmission prevents nodes from wasting considerable amount of energy receiving unwanted data packets. Multiple priority levels enable the network to support multiple levels of QoS.

Technology

This partially bio-based polymer film encapsulates pH-sensitive dye to detect food spoilage based on its pH levels. By incorporating stimuli-responsive and agricultural by-product materials, University of Florida researchers have developed a sustainable, cost-effective polymer packaging film for food products to detect spoilage. Researchers used glycerol, which results from the waste stream of biodiesel production, to synthesize a triacrylate monomer. The synthesized glycerol is then used to produce dendrimeric nanocapsules copolymerized in the presence of pH-sensitive dye, thereby encapsulating the dye into the polymer.
