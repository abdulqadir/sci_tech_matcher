Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling.

Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk.

High Processing Capacity The process can produce between 50kg/d and 25t/d, which can be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The yield is between 1/3 and 1/4 of raw material as charcoal. Meiwa Co., Ltd. has delivered more than 70 biomass carbonization plants since 1999, 15 of which went to foreign countries such as China and Vietnam.

They can run without electricity or water and are transportable by truck. Furthermore, with locally-procurable materials such as iron sheet, used containers of cargo ship and/or drum containers and basic facilities for ironworks, most parts can be manufactured on-site. Through conducting projects, Meiwa wishes to contribute to the country’s industrialization by (1) bringing new viable infrastructure for recycling organic waste, (2) transferring manufacturing methods to local technicians, (3) building capacity of local technicians on machine operation and maintenance, and (4) assisting biochar market establishment as fertilizer and/or fuel. In this context, Meiwa has already hosted a two-week internship for the 15 African students (all participants of ABE Initiative) from Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Botswana and Madagascar and another training for biomass-related experts from 10 countries worldwide in conjunction with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 2016. (2) Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production  Reduction of municipal waste taken to a landfill In most developing countries, municipal waste management has become a major problem as the result of population growth and rapid urbanization. Meiwa’s suggestion is to carbonize organic fractions of waste into biochar before they arrive at landfills where they get mixed with non-organic waste or pollutants. For example, in a non-capital city in Kenya, (i) vegetable waste generated in a city market and (ii) household sludge collected by trucks to a treatment lagoon take large part of waste in the municipal landfill. By carbonizing them at the market and the treatment lagoon, the amount of waste is expected to be reduced significantly. (3) Goal 13: Climate action  Economically-incentivized climate change countermeasure  On macro scale, fixing biochar (which used to be just another organic waste to be dumped and burnt with fuel) into soil is a carbon negative behavior. By using biochar, farmers will be a driving force to mitigate climate change even if they are not yet environmentally aware. Although exact number depends on material type and other conditions, generally the application of 100g of biochar approximately equals to reducing 160-170g of atmospheric carbon dioxide as compared to burning. Also, because of the high porosity, biochar works as soil conditioner for moisture control. Since biochar can make rainfed agriculture more resilient to irregular rainfall pattern, it has huge potential to contribute as climate change adaptation countermeasure as well.
