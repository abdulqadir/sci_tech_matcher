    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Versatility While common methods can only use dry materials, the Meiwa’s technology can process both wet and dry materials. Examples of wet materials include food waste, animal waste, human waste, and sludge. Dry materials include bamboo, residual wood, saw dust and rice husk. While common methods can only use dry materials, the Meiwa’s technology can process both wet and dry materials. Examples of wet materials include food waste, animal waste, human waste, and sludge. Dry materials include bamboo, residual wood, saw dust and rice husk. Meiwa has installed over 70 biomass carbonization plants for processing various ingredients. Meiwa has installed over 70 biomass carbonization plants for processing various ingredients. II. Energy Efficiency and Cost Efficiency An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  III. Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk.

Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk. IV. High Processing Capacity The process can produce between 50kg/d and 25t/d, which can be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The yield is between 1/3 and 1/4 of raw material as charcoal. Meiwa Co., Ltd. has delivered more than 70 biomass carbonization plants since 1999, 15 of which went to foreign countries such as China and Vietnam. About 85% of them were large scale plants, while the rest were small- to middle-scale plants (batch type).",

Therefore, physically copying the machine alone will not be competitive as such operation will likely require high running costs. Meiwa also supplies core parts from Japan. 2.      Human resources management Meiwa is interested in partnering with the local private sector that wishes to grow business as an agent. Meiwa will make every effort to manage human resources through incentivizing partners by actual sales performance and regularly having online/offline communication. 3.      Finding right partners in local private and public sectors To avoid fraud and other risks with inappropriate partners, Meiwa will first try to meet potential partners introduced by credible parties, such as international organizations, aid agencies, embassies, etc. as well as the ones attending high-level networking events such as TICAD. Meiwa will inquire the business record of foreign companies and project experience with the public sector. Meiwa does not intend to make any exclusive agreements.",

    "competitive_advantage": "Competitive advantage compared to products of competing enterprise (1) Advantages over competitors’ carbonization plants Various processable materials Based on our experience of installing more than 70 biomass carbonization plants, Meiwa has a market-proven method of processing both wet and dry materials, while typical competitors can only deal with dry materials. Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling. However, it is often a problem that the fermentation process requires a long time and the final output is hard to sell for value. Compared to this, our carbonization plant can complete the process within a day and the output is easier to sell (as powerful natural fertilizer/soil conditioner or fuel).",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Made of 100% Natural Ingredients eco-SPRAY is made of 100% natural ingredients. No hazardous or artificial chemicals are added. It is, therefore, non-toxic and does not leave any damage to cars after use. II. Easy Application eco-SPRAY is easy to apply. No preparation is required. To apply, simply remove a filter from a car engine and spray a whole bottle (30cc) through the filter. Leave it for 15 minutes until it is dry before putting it back in the car. The use of eco-SPRAY is recommended every 5,000km. III. Deep Cleaning eco-SPRAY is extremely effective in deep cleaning car engines. It removes carbon deposits from the carbon combustion chamber, cylinders, pistons, and valves. What is unique about eco-SPRAY is that it changes the fundamental chemistry of combustion. It improves how the engine uses its fuel. Eco-SPRAY breaks up the water molecules in the air entering the engine and turns them into hydrogen gas and negatively charged ions. The hydrogen gas boosts combustion while the negatively charged ions neutralize the static built up in the engine for improved fuel flow. This mechanism helps the engine to run more smoothly and to idle smoother and quieter. IV. Reduce Emissions  Incomplete combustion results in harmful gas emissions. With eco-SPRAY, harmful gas emissions are greatly reduced. A study conducted by the Japan Automobile Transport Technology Association (JATA) demonstrated that eco-SPRAY immediately reduces the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxide (NOx) by 30.4%, 23.3%, and 15.09%, respectively. V. Improve Fuel Efficiency Normally, 95% combustion is considered high. eco-SPRAY increases combustion efficiency to 95 to 100%. This contributes to better mileage, meaning less stop at the gas station is required. eco-SPRAY improves car performance by effectively cleaning the engine for better combustion efficiency. It provides more power and mileage. It also saves the environment by reducing harmful emissions.",
    "competitive_advantage": "Made with only natural materials Our company’s mission is to care for nature, humanity, plants and animals, and we strive to solve environmental problems by delivery of our eco-friendly products. The eco-SPRAY is made of 100% natural ingredients with no hazardous or artificial chemicals added. It is also non- toxic and will not cause any side effects to the cars after use. Improve Fuel Efficiency/Gas Mileage One bottle of eco-SPRAY (30ml) applied to the car air filter every 5,000 km can improve gas mileage up to 8-40% and reduce fuel consumption.

Easy Installation and Maintenance Installation of HMB is simple and does not take a long time or a large space. The space required by Dispersed-Microbes Process is 33% of the space required by a conventional process. Maintenance is also easy, and it does not require an experienced operator. Special training for maintenance staff is not required.   II. Cost Efficiency HMB significantly reduces the operational cost without compromising the compliance to the environmental quality standards. While the operational cost of a conventional process is 300,000~400,000 JPY, that of Dispersed-Microbes Process is 150,000~200,000. Maintenance costs only 30~50%of the cost of a conventional process. The cost for chemical agents to treat problems can also be reduced to 1/3 because they will not be needed.  III. Energy Efficiency HMB greatly saves power consumption. The electricity used to operate Dispersed-Microbes Process is only 66% of the electricity used to operate a conventional process. IV. Create More Jobs Installation of HMB involves a simple process. The HMB can be installed in many different sites. Therefore, it provides job opportunities to local people and contributes to the development of industrial sustainability. HMB is the best solution for wastewater treatment facilities in urban areas. One of the units has been installed in a factory located in the middle of a residential area, but the factory has never received a single complaint about foul odour or under-treated effluent from residents or city government over two years.

    "description": "“Dispersed-Microbes Process” invented by Hinode Sangyo is the revolutionary technology of the 21st century for wastewater treatment in place of well-established activated sludge process invented over 100 years ago. st A major problem in activated sludge process is occurrence of sludge “bulking” caused by the growth of filamentous microorganisms. Dispersed-Microbes Process intrinsically prevents sludge bulking, which ensures smooth processing of highly concentrated wastewater. Hinode Sangyo’s Dispersed-Microbes Process remarkably enhances efficiency of wastewater treatment by activating aerobic microorganisms. Dispersed-Microbes Process is the cutting-edge technology in terms of energy-saving, minimized use of wastewater treatment agents, ease of maintenance, minimized size of wastewater processing plant, complete elimination of foul smell, all of which have never been entirely achieved by other technologies in the history.                         Microbubble generator HMB (exhibition)   Microbubble generator (on land) Area: Prevention & destruction of pollution : Industrial waste water Related Links Water treatment (industrial wastewater): Clean Move A new environmental technology on the database (Hinode Microbubble Generator (HMB)) A new environmental technology on the database (Vanadium Flow Battery System) A new environmental technology on the database (Concentrator Photovoltaic (CPV)) A new environmental technology on the database (Filtering Technology for Combustion Effic…",

Earth-friendly, this filtration device significantly adheres to requirements set forth by ISO14000. In line with environmental standards, MST is safe for use in many applications. MST is able to remove suspended substances via Siphon Washing Technology, conducting backwashing only as needed for rinsing away suspended substances. This means the amount of backwashing water is largely reduced, compared with most conventional sand filtration devices that require frequent backwashing. In addition, the outflow of exfoliated sludge is drastically reduced, resulting in an overall high cleaning effect. Crushing of the media filter is impossible due to the kneading action of the unit. When sewage water containing organic matter is treated by the conventional filter tanks, filter media can’t keep up and may suffer proper functioning as a result. That’s where MOBILE SIPHON TANK comes in: to prevent fixation and keep media perpetually clean through Siphon Washing Technology. This means washing only has to happen for one minute a day. MST can cut back on about 10% of CO2 emissions in comparison with traditional sand filtration devices. Why?

    "competitive_advantage": "RPPWF™ is a class 4 solid recovered fuel, registered in the international fuel list CEN 343, and is expected to be the promising alternative resource to coal and oil. For example, RPPWF™ has a higher calorific value (over 25MJ/Kg) than coal (generally between 19-22 MJ/Kg). Compared to coal, RPPWF™ has about 20% less moisture and approximately 50% less ash. The content of Sulphur in RPPWF™ is almost negligible while coal generally contains up to about 10%. Furthermore, the CO2 emission from burning RPPWF™ is almost one third, compared to that from burning coal. Because of this ‘green’ characteristics, RPPWF™ is alternatively called Green Coal™ (this name is also a registered trademark). RPPWF™ also has higher biomass contents than conventional biomass resources. In the case of RPPWF™, more than 85% is biomass content (rests are plants or plastics).    RPPWF™ satisfies the European standard for solid recovered fuel, CEN 343, and also has certifications of ISO 14001 and ISO 9001.",
    "performance": "Because the raw materials for RPPWF™ are 100% biomass (i.e. paper, plant and wood wastes), CO2 emission of the procurement of raw materials can be mostly reduced to zero. Moreover, biomass as raw materials means less cost to procure than any other fuel resources such as coal and oil. Heat recovery rate of RPPWF™ is over 70% and the combustion efficiency is about 98% which are much higher than those of coal and oil.   The CO2 emission reduced from producing RPPWF™ can be used for CO2 credit for domestic and/or international emissions trading.   The production process of RPPWF™ is operated with heat-pump technology, a device proving heat through low carbon emission, which further improves the overall emission of the production process.",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. ElbicNEOTM TM ElbicNEOTM is an agent that provides Bacillus subtilis strains to wastewater. Wastewater from food or beverage factories contains organic matters, detergents, pesticides, and rinse water. Microbes in this wastewater are unable to survive due to lack of dissolved oxygen. Organic matters are, therefore, left untreated. The microbes in ElbicNEOTM (ElbicNEO microbes) can survive in this harsh environment by forming spores to resist chemicals, heat, and pH. They grow fast and double their number every 20 minutes. Continuous injection of ElbicNEOTM allows stable and consistent treatment of wastewater, regardless of its characteristics. ElbicNEO microbes decompose proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates and inhibit the growth of coliforms. ElbicNEOTM is effective in wastewater of low oxygen concentration. TM TM TM TM II. ElbicNEO IncubatorTM TM The ElbicNEO microbes can be incubated in a fully automated device called ElbicNEO IncubatorTM. This incubator provides optimal conditions for the microbes to grow. It requires clean tap water to operate and increases the microbial population by 25 times. Growing ElbicNEOTM microbes in this incubator will significantly reduce the cost to purchase the strains. The microbes are automatically injected into wastewater treatment plants. ElbicNEO IncubatorTM is especially useful in treating wastewater containing a large amount of fat and chemicals because it can continuously provide a lot of microbes. For this reason, the incubator has been installed in dairy and other food processing factories, which extensively produce dairy cream and shortening. TM TM TM III. Two-Step System: ElbicYoutry-1TM & ElbicBZ-OTM TM TM A large amount of lipid (oils and fats) is found in wastewater from food and beverage factories. In wastewater treatment systems, however, decomposing lipids is challenging. Effective treatment of lipids proposed by the company involves two steps; 1) emulsification and dispersion, and 2) enzymatic hydrolysis. In the first step, ElbicYoutry-1TM, a specially developed non-toxic surfactant, is used. When the surfactant is injected into a water tank via Automatic Injection Device, it reduces the surface tension of water and quickly disperses lipids into small particles. In the second step, the wastewater is transferred to an aeration tank, and ElbicBZ-OTM is injected. ElbicBZ-OTM is a family of Bacillus subtilis and contains highly active enzymes (lipase and phospholipase). With the enzymes, lipids are broken down into free fatty acids and glycerin, which can be digested in the activated sludge. TM TM TM The Elbic Series is a practical wastewater treatment solution in food processing industry.",
    "applications": "Since the beginning of 20th Century, activated sludge method has been widely used in domestic wastewater and industrial effluent treatment. However, food processing industry has been and are facing serious challenges in wastewater treatment since Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system was officially introduced in Japan in 1996. Prevalence of the HACCP system forces food processing industry (i.e. food and beverage processing, dairy operations and meatpacking) to use much more detergents and pesticides, which are discharged in wastewater, than before. Excessive amount of detergents and pesticides in wastewater could weaken or exterminate microorganisms in the activated sludge which are to be used for decomposing organic matters into carbon dioxide, water and ammonia (i.e. hindering aerobic wastewater treatment). Hinode Sangyo Co., Ltd. has developed practical solutions in terms of both cost and performance to address the foregoing challenges. Conceivable applications of our solutions are as follows: 1. Wastewater treatment for all-round food industry, including food and beverage processing, dairy operations, meatpacking, palm oil mill effluent (POME), cattle breeding, aquaculture.  2. Wastewater treatment for restaurants, hotels, condominiums, shopping malls and commercial facilities.",
    "performance": "1. Elbic NEO™ (Concentration culture medium contents Bacillus Subtilis strain) System:  1. Elbic NEO™ (Concentration culture medium contents Bacillus Subtilis strain) System:  Wastewater of food/beverage processing plants contains high density of organic matters as well as detergents/pesticides and rinse water of Clean-in-Place (CIP) systems required by HACCP, which renders tremendous difficulty to conventional wastewater treatment systems. Microorganisms living in ordinary aeration tanks are unable to survive wastewater containing high density of organic matters due to lack of dissolved oxygen. Chlorine or invert soap contained in detergents instantly eradicates microorganisms, which leaves organic matters in wastewater untreated. ElbicNEO microorganism survives such kind of harsh environment by sporulation, and starts growing as soon as nutrients are in place. Regardless of the characteristics of discharged wastewater, continuous injection of ElbicNEO ensures stable and consistent treatment of wastewater even in the conventional aerobic treatment systems. ElbicNEO is highly-effective microorganism having the following remarkable advantages: – High capability of decomposing protein, oil/fat, corbohydrates  – Suppressing growth of coliform;  – Highly dispersible, and staying active even under low resolved oxygen:  – Fast growth at an exponential rate through cell division every 20 minutes;  – Acting vividly to consume energy; and  – Sporulating to gain protection against detergents/pesticides, heat and pH. 2. ElbicNEO Incubator™: 2. ElbicNEO Incubator™: Hinode Sangyo Co.,Ltd. has developed an incubator to incubate ElbicNEO microorganism on-site. ElbicNEO Incubator can proliferate ElbicNEO microbes by 25 times just by pouring clean (tap) water into the incubator. ElbicNEO incubator is operated fully automatically to control continuous injection of ElbicNEO into wastewater treatment plants in an appropriate manner. It also helps significantly reduce the cost of ElbicNEO microorganisms. ElbicNEO incubators have been installed at the wastewater treatment facilities of dairy operations plants and food processing factories that extensively use dairy cream and shortening. Those plants and factories discharge high-fat effluent and a large volume of detergents/pesticides. 3. Two-Step System (ElbicBZ-O™ along with ElbicYoutry-1™): 3. Two-Step System (ElbicBZ-O™ along with ElbicYoutry-1™): Step 1: Youtry-1 is injected in the adjusting tank through Automatic Injection Device for efficient emulsification and dispersion of oil/fat. ElbicYoutry-1™  Oil/fat forms oil/fat layer in conventional wastewater microbial treatment systems find it difficult to remove oil/grease efficiently. Intensive aeration forces large clusters of oil/fat to float on the surface, which prevents contact with decomposing microorganisms in activated sludge. ElbicYourty-1 was developed to solve the foregoing problem. ElbicYourty-1, a sugar-family special surfactant agent, which is safe to humans, animals and plants. By virtue of its strong emulsifying capacity, Elbic Youtry-1 reduces surface tension of water, and quickly disperses oil/grease to small particles so that ElbicBZ-O can efficiently decompose oil/fat in the next step. Step 2: Wastewater is transferred to aeration tank where ElbicBZ-O is injected to hydrolyze the lipids to fatty acid and glycerin by virtue of lipase generated by ElbicBZ-O. Free fatty acid is easily decomposed to water-soluble acetyl compound, and digested along with glycerin by activated sludge.  ElbicBZ-O™  ElbicBZ-O, family of Bacillus Subtilis, have the advantages as follows:  ElbicBZ-O™ – Containing highly active lipase and phospholipase;  – Superb decomposition capacity of higher fatty acid;  – Fast proliferation;  – Sporulating to gain protection against environmental aggravation (poor nutrient, inflow of pesticides, acid and alkaline) and  – Bacillus Subtilis belongs to the same family of NATTO （Japanese food）bacterium, which has been proved to be safe over the past centuries. Bacillus Subtilis cohabits with microbes in activated sludge and enhances decomposition capacity. Effluent discharged from food processing plants and beverage factories contains high concentration of oil and fat. Currently, oil and fat are flocculated and floated with pressurized resolved air, which results in generation of enormous amount of froth to constitute 50 to 80% of the total excessive sludge. This process is referred to as physical separation method, while Hinode Sangyo Co,,Ltd. offers microbial decomposition/degradation of oil/fat, whose advantage is to substantially reduce total excessive sludge without using flocculants.",

This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  III. Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk.

Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk. IV. High Processing Capacity The process can produce between 50kg/d and 25t/d, which can be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The yield is between 1/3 and 1/4 of raw material as charcoal. Meiwa Co., Ltd. has delivered more than 70 biomass carbonization plants since 1999, 15 of which went to foreign countries such as China and Vietnam. About 85% of them were large scale plants, while the rest were small- to middle-scale plants (batch type).",
    "applications": "Simply put, biomass carbonization plant is a waste recycling plant that can convert almost anything organic into charcoal (called biochar). Processable materials include sludge, human waste, chicken manure, scrap wood, agricultural residue, food waste and water hyacinth among others. As biochar can work as a natural fertilizer, soil conditioner, fuel etc., Meiwa’s biomass carbonization technology provides solutions to waste management and agriculture, environment and/or energy at the same time.",
    "performance": "Processable materials: Both wet biomass (e.g. sludge, human waste, and animal waste, water hyacinth, food waste etc.) and dry biomass (saw dust, rice husk, residual wood, bamboo, etc.) Output products: Charcoal (biochar) that can be used as a natural fertilizer, soil conditioner and/or fuel Processing capacity: From 50kg/d to 25t/d, adjustable upon client’s request Yield of output products: About 1/3~1/4 of raw material (as charcoal) Optional unit: Drying unit, power generation unit*, wood vinegar harvesting unit*, desulfurization unit, etc. *ingredient-selective",
    "risk": "1.      Intellectual property-related risks Meiwa’s patent covers a specific method of plant operation. Therefore, physically copying the machine alone will not be competitive as such operation will likely require high running costs. Meiwa also supplies core parts from Japan. 2.      Human resources management Meiwa is interested in partnering with the local private sector that wishes to grow business as an agent. Meiwa will make every effort to manage human resources through incentivizing partners by actual sales performance and regularly having online/offline communication. 3.      Finding right partners in local private and public sectors To avoid fraud and other risks with inappropriate partners, Meiwa will first try to meet potential partners introduced by credible parties, such as international organizations, aid agencies, embassies, etc. as well as the ones attending high-level networking events such as TICAD. Meiwa will inquire the business record of foreign companies and project experience with the public sector. Meiwa does not intend to make any exclusive agreements.",

Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling. However, it is often a problem that the fermentation process requires a long time and the final output is hard to sell for value. Compared to this, our carbonization plant can complete the process within a day and the output is easier to sell (as powerful natural fertilizer/soil conditioner or fuel).",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. No filter media replacement Filter media can be used semi-permanently without the need for replacement, with zero need for disposal of dirty, used filter media as industrial waste. Earth-friendly, this filtration device significantly adheres to requirements set forth by ISO14000. In line with environmental standards, MST is safe for use in many applications. MST is able to remove suspended substances via Siphon Washing Technology, conducting backwashing only as needed for rinsing away suspended substances. This means the amount of backwashing water is largely reduced, compared with most conventional sand filtration devices that require frequent backwashing. In addition, the outflow of exfoliated sludge is drastically reduced, resulting in an overall high cleaning effect. Crushing of the media filter is impossible due to the kneading action of the unit. When sewage water containing organic matter is treated by the conventional filter tanks, filter media can’t keep up and may suffer proper functioning as a result. That’s where MOBILE SIPHON TANK comes in: to prevent fixation and keep media perpetually clean through Siphon Washing Technology. This means washing only has to happen for one minute a day. MST can cut back on about 10% of CO2 emissions in comparison with traditional sand filtration devices. Why? It doesn’t have to get rid of used media, thereby decreasing the amount of backwashing water and electricity consumption necessary. Certified as “Low CO2 Kawasaki Brand” by Kawasaki-city in Japan, MST is a major contributor to compliance with non-polluting zero-emission efforts. V. Track records The Siphon Washing Technology was invented in 1997. Since then, it has been exhibited in major foreign exhibitions, such as IFAT in Germany, Aquatech in the Netherlands, WEFTEC in the US and The Big 5 in UAE. At this time, 100 devices have been applied over the globe, including Japan, German, Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Philippines and Mozambique. VI.

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages Process flow diagram I. No Separation Is Needed Separation of other materials is not required with Micro-Sizer. For instance, caps and labels do not have to be removed from glass bottles before they are crushed. Liquid, a smell of alcohol, sugar and salt content are also eliminated during the crushing process. Glass recycling is easier with Micro-Sizer. II. Efficient Crusher Unlike conventional hammer crushers and mills, Micro-Sizer does not take up a lot of space. The area required for installation is only 4m x 6m. Micro-Sizer is, however, a powerful machine with 11 rotors that operate at a rotation speed of 1,800 rpm. It produces as much as 3 tons of glass cullet per hour. III. Cullet Applications Glass cullet comes in different sizes between 0.05mm and 5.00mm. Micro-Sizer spins glass at a very high speed (around 1800rpm), smoothening the sharp edges of the crushed glass. The final product is edgeless powdery glass cullet that is safe to touch and use. The glass cullet has many applications. Larger cullet is mixed with cement for concrete construction or with asphalt for road construction. Smaller cullet is mixed with bricks, ceramics, and blocks to lower their baking temperature. Glass cullet is also used as artificial sand in the beaches that suffer coastal erosion, is mixed with paint coating for fluorescent display for road traffic, or is mixed with clay soil to improve its quality. Application of powder glass cullet IV. Less Operating Cost A special metal material is used for Micro-Sizer parts. The material of internal part is more resistant to wear than iron and aluminum that are typically used in the hammer crushers and mills. This special material is long-lasting and therefore significantly reduces the operating cost in a longer perspective. Currently, about ten units of Micro-Sizer are used in the Unites States, and 20 units are used in Japan. Although hammer crushers and mills are still popular glass crushers today, Micro-Sizer would efficiently crush glass into safe powdery glass cullet that has many useful applications.",
    "competitive_advantage": "Generally, hammer crusher and mill are popular for crushing waste glasses today. Micro-Sizer is unique and more efficient equipment than conventional hammer crusher and mill. This is because of the compact dry process as well as efficient impurity separation process of the Micro-Sizer which can produce about 3 ton of glass cullet per hour (up to the powder size of 0.05mm).  The operating cost can be reduced significantly because of the wear proof metal material used in the Micro-Sizer which is thought to cost much less than that of hammer crusher and mill, from long-term perspective.",
    "technical_maturity": "Since 1995, we have been successfully developing our business especially in the US and Japan. About 20 Micro-Sizers have been successfully installed in the US.

II. Adherence to Strict Standards The strict standards of the company even meet the requirements of Japan’s National Effluent Standards of 0.005 mg/L, which is a standard applied to landfill disposal requirements. Furthermore, the Minamata Convention on Mercury speculates there will be an increase in surplus mercury and subsequent demand for solidification and stabilization processes. Nomura Kohsan has responded in kind by conducting tests and research on these technologies that have also cleared the National Effluent Standards.

    "competitive_advantage": "Nomura Kohsan is the only company in Japan with an all-inclusive facility that has the capacity to recycle, treat and process a wide variety of mercury waste. Such company is also rare, globally. Furthermore, despite Japan’s National Effluent Standards of 0.005 mg/L (a standard used for landfill disposal) being one of the world’s most stringent standards, our treatment process meets the requirements of this standard. More recently, with the Minamata Convention on Mercury, it is perceived that there will be an increase in surplus mercury and as a result a demand for solidification and stabilization processes. We have conducted tests and research on these technologies and have cleared the National Effluent Standards. Although the dry process for treating used fluorescent lamps is more mainstream, we employ the wet process since we have the technology to treat mercury-containing  liquid waste. With this technology, we are capable of treating all types of fluorescent lamps, and nearly 100% of the lamp is recycled. Nomura Kohsan has signed a memorandum of understanding with UNIDO in April 2014. We have agreed to cooperate on projects that manage waste from mercury and to disseminate technology to developing countries. South East Asian countries will be our main focus, where we will be actively cooperating in the mercury waste treatment and recycling activities.

The company and mine closed down and Nomura Kohsan was established in 1973. Since then, for over 40 years we have specialized in treating, processing and recycling mercury waste. Treatment and processing record from the past 3 years FY 2013: approx. 25,000t (2013.4.1～2014.3.31)  FY 2012: approx. 27,000t (2012.4.1～2013.3.31)  FY 2011: approx. 26,000t (2011.4.1～2012.3.31) Past record of waste imported from abroad Taiwan:  Dry cell batteries, button cell batteries, HID lamps: approx. 3,200t (2006~ 2014.6) Philippines:  Fluorescent lamps: approx. 60t (2002～2014.6) Until now, we have been importing uncrushed lamps from the Philippines and have been treating and recycling the lamps in Japan. However, in 2014, with the support of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) we have established a new recycling scheme for the Philippines. We installed a lamp crusher in the Philippines, thus allowing lamps to be crushed locally. The crushed lamps will be shipped to our facility.  Through this local pre-treatment process, we will be able to reduce the transportation fee, which in turn, will cut the cost of the whole recycling process. Moreover, by setting up a pre-treatment facility, we aim to raise awareness and increase the recycling rate in the Philippines.",

Through this process, Hg-contaminated sludge is collected, which is then sent to the furnace for roasting (for more information on roasting process see “conceivable application”). In addition to this, fluorescent powder (which is collected during the crushing process) contains traces of Hg, so it also goes though the roasting process in order to retrieve mercury. Recovered materials are recycled into the following products:   Mercury ⇒ used in fluorescent lamps, reagent, etc.   Glass ⇒ raw material for: glass wool (fiberglass), glass (for fluorescent lamps), and cement   metallic base ⇒ raw material for aluminum   fluorescent powder ⇒ raw material for rare earth Percentage (of the whole lamp) recycled: nearly 100% ■ For dry-cell batteries ■  Secondary batteries are removed through a two-step process of sorting (shape-based sorting and manual sorting). Afterwards, they are sent to specialized companies for recycling. Only primary batteries are processed at our facility. First, the batteries go through a roasting process in the rotary kiln so that the mercury can be vaporized and recovered.

The crushing process is also called “dry process.” During this process, laminated glass is crushed until it is in the granular state. Unlike conventional glass crushers that can ruin attached interlayer, FDS1250 crushes and removes 50 to 70% glass cullet of laminated glass without damaging the interlayer so that the glass does not contain other materials and can be reused in different products. II. Separation of Glass and Interlayer NDF-1000 The crushed laminated glass undergoes separation or “wet process,” using the exfoliator, NDF1000S. The separation process involves chemical stripping and shear force to wash off glass fragments. A specially developed solution kept at the best temperature is used to separate the glass fragments from the interlayer. The glass fragments are washed off in a rotary drum (water treatment tank). With this technique, neither glass nor interlayer gets damaged or changes its quality. The NDF1000S removes over 99.96% of glass fragments and allows the interlayer to be recycled. III. 3R Promotion Recycling laminated glass represents 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) promotion. FDS1250 and NDF1000S do not only reduce landfills but also allow both glass and interlayer to be reused. The machines directly contribute to saving the environment. To date, there is no other commercial record of machines like FDS1250 and NDF1000S in the world. Donico Inter Co., Ltd. has sold two units of these machines last year in Japan and received orders from overseas as well. The demand for these machines is expected to rise as the number of automobile recycling operation is increasing both in developed and emerging nations. The company desires to expand their business especially in Asian countries that are currently undergoing rapid growth. Stripping Method of FDS1250 tripping method of NDF1000S",

It works by thermally decomposing organic carbon such as MSW (M  and biomass to generate the fuel gas, rotate the engine, and generate electricity.  II. Thermal Decomposition Rather Than Incineration This technology allows waste to be thermally decomposed rather than incinerated, which results in the generation of fuel gas with a high caloric value. In the past, the only option to get rid of waste was to bury it or incinerate it. With thermochemical decomposition and gasification, this is no longer necessary. Thanks to a one of a kind rotary design, twice as much fuel gas generation can take place, when compared with standard pyrolysis technologies. This design (U-turn kiln) allows for more than 80% energy recovery ratio. IV. Used for Power Generation  IV. Used for Power Generation  Small-scale plants can use this gas for power generation. In addition, the fuel gas and hydrogen can be utilized for batteries and chemical supplies.  Small-scale plants can use this gas for power generation.

    "competitive_advantage": "<Competitor 1: other biofuel/conventional fossil fuel> Advantage 1 - cheaper substitution of fossil diesel: the rural population will save USD 0.4-0.5/litter when Jatropha fuel is used as a replacement of diesel oil (price of Jatropha fuel is about USD 1.3/litter and diesel oil in remote areas is about USD 1.7-1.8/litter). Also, while the price of fossil fuel changes depending on the market situation, Jatropha fuel can be supplied with better stability of price. Advantage 1 - cheaper substitution of fossil diesel Advantage 2 - means to produce energy with low investment/cost: since Jatropha requires least financial and labour inputs to cultivation, initial investment is smaller for investors or business owners compared to dedicated plantation models. Advantage 2 - means to produce energy with low investment/cost Advantage 3 - means to produce energy with a minimum social and environmental impact, but deliver additional income: NBF's model does not disturb livelihood or agricultural activities of participating farmers since Jatropha can be cultivated as the hedgerows of garden or field. It does not affect agricultural activities as farmers does not have to take care of Jatropha trees and harvest can be done in their spare time, but can deliver additional income to farmers. Advantage 3 - means to produce energy with a minimum social and environmental impact, but deliver additional income <Competitor 2: energy supply from solar panels and national grid> Advantage 4 - multiple usage of fuel: in rural areas, demands for the use of liquid fuel are still high for agricultural machinery such as maize mills, rice mills, water pumps etc. While solar panel or power grid can supply energy only in the form of electricity, Jatropha fuel can be used for power generation as well as agricultural machineries depending on the demand. Advantage 4 - multiple usage of fuel <Competitor 3: conventional agriculture activities> Advantage 5 - development impact: It will create an opportunity for the participating farmers to enhance their quality of life (i.e. better health condition, social service) as well as income generation opportunity. It is also NBF’s strategy to involve farmers in the value chain so they can receive benefit and become essential part of their life in order to secure the procurement of Jatropha seed. For the project plan until 2018, NBF estimates that: Advantage 5 - development impact: 27,200 farmer households and 3,600 small and medium enterprises will directly benefit a total of more than $6,000,000 by the year 2018. The business will create more than 1,000 employments in the year 2015 and 2016, and 100 employments from the year 2016 onwards. The affordable energy will enable rural residents to receive better social services (i.e. for vaccination storage with refrigerator and safer childbirth in the health centers). <Competitor 4: chemical fertiliser> Advantage 6 - Affordable and locally-available fertiliser: national average of farmer's access to fertilizers is about 3 to 6%, because of the limited access to fertiliser itself, and the high price due to import and transportation costs. Jatropha fertiliser can be supplied for one tenth of chemical fertiliser's price. The local households could save USD 1.44/ kilogram by purchasing Jatropha fertilizer.

    "risk": "Security risk for raw material procurement (Jatropha seeds)  Positive commitment of farmers for cultivation activity is essential for the success of this business model. NBF is strategically establishing the network with approximately 6,000 farmers in Cabo Delgado. To strengthen the tie with the farmers, NBF keeps constant communication with the farmers’ clubs through regular visits, and also purchasing their agricultural products (i.e. rice), and even selling daily consumables to farmers in some areas. By becoming essential part of farmers’ life by bringing various benefits to them, farmers will continue to sell the seeds to NBF and are unlikely to be disturbed by other buyers who come into the area afterwards. Security risk for raw material procurement (Jatropha seeds) Risk regarding losing competitiveness due to the price drop of liquid fossil fuels and access increase to the grid electricity.  According to the world trend of fossil fuel market, the fossil fuel price is unlikely to drop in the long run unless there will be a dramatic market change or infrastructure development in the area, which is unlikely to happen given the situation. Risk regarding losing competitiveness due to the price drop of liquid fossil fuels and access increase to the grid electricity. Risk related to land pressure and water usage  There are possibilities of competition with other agricultural crops over the use of land and water resources. In the NBF’s model, Jatrpha will be planted along the border of farm land as live fences and not be planted inside the farmland, which indicates, unlike centralised plantation cultivation model, that the land pressure will not affect the cultivation of Jatropha. Moreover, Jatropha does not need a large quantity of water to grow and it survives in semi-arid areas. Thus, there are very little possibility of conflicts over water use as compared to other cash crops. Risk related to land pressure and water usage Risk associated to the climate conditions  Basically Jatrropha is a drought resistant plant. However, when the extreme whether such as severe dought or flooding the harvest of Jatropha could drop for a certain amount. Unlike other agricultural crops, Jatropha can be stablely stored in seeds or in oil, therefore, some drop of harvest can be covered with stock. Also in preparation for such event, by modifying blending ratio of Jatropha oil and other additives, production amount of end product (JAT-DIESEL) can be controlled.

In our past work, we recognized the importance of food recycling when considering whether it was possible to recycle food waste. With this in mind, we have established our own technology to make high quality compost by recycling food waste. The produced compost (100% organic fertilizer) is certified as Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) product. So far we have established two Bio Plaza facilities in Japan. One is in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture, established in 2002, and the other one is in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, established in 2007. For instance, Bio Plaza in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, processes food wastes of 100 ton per day. The amount of compost produced is 22 ton per day. Odor of food waste is well controlled as the composting plants are built in a closed method. By considering global environmental sustainability, we have a policy to use renewable energy as much as possible when needed for processing food wastes with fermentation technology.",
    "risk": "Because our facility involves the use of natural providence (i.e. organic food waste), it is sometimes difficult to operate and maintain the amount of food wastes to be recycled and the amount of compost to be produced.

Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling. However, it is often a problem that the fermentation process requires a long time and the final output is hard to sell for value. Compared to this, our carbonization plant can complete the process within a day and the output is easier to sell (as powerful natural fertilizer/soil conditioner or fuel).",

It works by thermally decomposing organic carbon such as MSW (M  and biomass to generate the fuel gas, rotate the engine, and generate electricity.  II. Thermal Decomposition Rather Than Incineration This technology allows waste to be thermally decomposed rather than incinerated, which results in the generation of fuel gas with a high caloric value. In the past, the only option to get rid of waste was to bury it or incinerate it. With thermochemical decomposition and gasification, this is no longer necessary. Thanks to a one of a kind rotary design, twice as much fuel gas generation can take place, when compared with standard pyrolysis technologies. This design (U-turn kiln) allows for more than 80% energy recovery ratio. IV. Used for Power Generation  IV. Used for Power Generation  Small-scale plants can use this gas for power generation. In addition, the fuel gas and hydrogen can be utilized for batteries and chemical supplies.  Small-scale plants can use this gas for power generation. In addition, the fuel gas and hydrogen can be utilized for batteries and chemical supplies.  V. No Harmful By-Products This technology does not produce harmful by-products like nitrogen oxide or dioxin. As a result, there is no treatment process needed.

    "competitive_advantage": "RPPWF™ is a class 4 solid recovered fuel, registered in the international fuel list CEN 343, and is expected to be the promising alternative resource to coal and oil. For example, RPPWF™ has a higher calorific value (over 25MJ/Kg) than coal (generally between 19-22 MJ/Kg). Compared to coal, RPPWF™ has about 20% less moisture and approximately 50% less ash. The content of Sulphur in RPPWF™ is almost negligible while coal generally contains up to about 10%. Furthermore, the CO2 emission from burning RPPWF™ is almost one third, compared to that from burning coal. Because of this ‘green’ characteristics, RPPWF™ is alternatively called Green Coal™ (this name is also a registered trademark). RPPWF™ also has higher biomass contents than conventional biomass resources. In the case of RPPWF™, more than 85% is biomass content (rests are plants or plastics).    RPPWF™ satisfies the European standard for solid recovered fuel, CEN 343, and also has certifications of ISO 14001 and ISO 9001.",
    "performance": "Because the raw materials for RPPWF™ are 100% biomass (i.e. paper, plant and wood wastes), CO2 emission of the procurement of raw materials can be mostly reduced to zero. Moreover, biomass as raw materials means less cost to procure than any other fuel resources such as coal and oil. Heat recovery rate of RPPWF™ is over 70% and the combustion efficiency is about 98% which are much higher than those of coal and oil.   The CO2 emission reduced from producing RPPWF™ can be used for CO2 credit for domestic and/or international emissions trading.   The production process of RPPWF™ is operated with heat-pump technology, a device proving heat through low carbon emission, which further improves the overall emission of the production process.",
    "risk": "Language barrier, law and regulations of candidate countries might become challenges when installing RPPWF™ production line and establishing supply chain network.

    "features_and_advantages": "I. Safety and Stability This fully-automated water supply system enables not only safe but also stable water supply. Wellthy’s membrane separation technology takes away the contaminants from raw water and converts it into drinking water that is safe to the consumer. There is little maintenance and operational commitment thanks to its fully automated features. This ensures steady and stable results.   II. Low Start-Up Costs Because this is a decentralized system, there are low initial costs and O&M costs associated with this technology, as compared to larger, more centralized water treatment systems. Operating on a small scale, this water treatment system suits individual business institutions such as hospitals, residential buildings, and shopping centers, installed at the client’s site. No long supply pipelines are necessary and  minimal construction costs are involved. III. Energy Efficient Not as much energy is required, as compared with centralized systems, when it comes to water intake, treatment and supply. IV. Remote Monitoring Operational conditions and water quality data can be accessed from any location, not just on-site. The system can be operated from remote areas, so it is ideal for areas in which access is difficult. Potential applications include large institutions that require large amounts of clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets. This water treatment system is desirable because of its low initial installation cost. More than 1,200 water treatment systems have been installed so far in Japan. Some pilot systems have been rolled out in Kenya, Africa, Vietnam, and Myanmar as well. Wellthy Corporation specializes in providing total engineering to water solutions, including many facets such as plant engineering, operation and maintenance, research and development, and water analysis.",
    "applications": "Wellthy’s water treatment system is a small-scale, on-site water treatment and supply system that utilizes existing water resource at the customer’s compound and treats the water into drinking water that meets the drinking water quality standards. The water source can be groundwater, surface water and water from public supply system. Our water treatment system combines pre-treatment process and membrane separation technology, depending on the quality of the raw water, to remove contaminants such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic.",
    "performance": "We usually design small-scale water treatment and supply systems that have a capacity from 50 to 1,000 m3/day. One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy consumption, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. Also, water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines. 3 As for the water treatment performance, our technology can improve the quality of water to meet the customer’s needs, because we design each system for every client. For example, we operate a system that produces drinking water from raw water with Color: 350 NTU, Turbidity: 62 NTU, Fe: 3.3 mg/L and Mn: 1.8 mg/L, just for your reference.",
    "risk": "Depending on the raw water quality, water treatment process could become more complex.

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. No special tank is needed The system can be installed in a tank made of any materials including concrete, stainless steel, and polyethylene. There is no need to purchase a special tank for the installation. A tank is first filled with unpurified water, and the manual stir pump is placed inside the tank.   II. Amount of Treatable Water The maximum amount of water to be purified in a single tank is five cubic meters (five tons) with a manual stir pump. The manual stir pump is not required when the water purified is a small amount. III. Flocculating Agent A flocculating agent is added to the unpurified water before the water is stirred manually. The amount of the agent must be precise (about 150 to 300 grams/m3 of water). The ingredients of the agent are determined through a water analysis, but they contain a special safe additive produced by Nippon Poly-Glu Co.Ltd. The additive is based on PGα21ca, which is produced using the bacteria called Bacillus natto. IV. Easy-to-Use Manual Stir Pump The manual stir pump used in this system is specially developed by the company. It is durable and comes in different sizes depending on the size of the tank. The operation is easy. Even women, children and elderly can turn the handle. When the handle is turned, water is spiraled up and down with the help of screws. The stirred water dissociates into purified water and sediments. The accumulated sediments can be removed through a valve located at the bottom of the tank. V. Cost Cost depends on the quality of local water to be processed. Local water must be first analyzed for its contents, and the result will be used to determine the material composition of the flocculating agent. The cost of the manual stir pump for a 1,000-liter water tank is 250,000JPY, while that of a flocculating agent per 20kg is from 25,000 to 30,000JPY. VI. Easy Maintenance The entire system is simple and requires little maintenance. The system is currently being used in various countries.

Because of the iron, the arsenic, and fluorine cannot be removed, and other flocculating agents cannot be used. It is not predicable because it depends on the quality of local water. For reference, a manually operated stir pump for a 1000-liter water tank costs 250,000 yen. The flocculating agents for 20 kilograms cost from 25,000 to 30,000 yen. However, this is the price for delivery in Japan.",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages Major Features and Advantages I. High Sensitivity The laser technology provides excellent linearity (which measures 0.0000-2.0000 mg/L turbidity unit) and enables stable and continuous measurement of submicron particles found in water at extremely low concentration. The devices effectively monitor leakage from a membrane filter, which increases the chance of preventing pathogens such as Cryptosporidium contaminating the water. II. Easy Operation The operation of the devices is easy and simple. One can analyze water simply by connecting the device to a flowing water sample. III. Maintenance & Cost No frequent maintenance is required. The devices have a “clean structure,” which resists contamination of a sample cell. The sensors can be easily removed, and the sample cell can be cleaned easily. The laser used in the devices has a long lifetime enabling them to be continuously used for a long time without calibration. The operating cost of the devices is, therefore, low. IV. Examples of Use The devices are suitable for the following; 1) turbidity management at the filtered water outlet to follow countermeasure guidelines for Cryptosporidium etc., 2) as a sensor to detect rupture of filtration membrane in a water purification facility, 3) performance evaluation of a process such as precipitation, activated carbon treatment, and sand filtration, and 4) management of circulating filtered water outlet (e.g. pool water.) Microtech Inc. is a company with expertise in turbidity detection and particle counting in water business. Their turbidity meters developed based on their previous similar technology have been distributed for more than ten years, and thousands of units are currently installed in water treatment facilities throughout the country.",
    "competitive_advantage": "More and more hollow fiber membrane technology has been introduced to produce drinking water. While the conventional turbidity detection method overlooks one-fiber-break leakage, our method can detect it to have much better chance to find pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. Our superior design creates a long laser life and enables you to continuously operate it with infrequent maintenance service.",
    "technical_maturity": "Our technology has been proved to be effective from 2004. As a result, over one thousand units are currently being operated at governmental drinking water treatment plants all over Japan.

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. No filter media replacement Filter media can be used semi-permanently without the need for replacement, with zero need for disposal of dirty, used filter media as industrial waste. Earth-friendly, this filtration device significantly adheres to requirements set forth by ISO14000. In line with environmental standards, MST is safe for use in many applications. MST is able to remove suspended substances via Siphon Washing Technology, conducting backwashing only as needed for rinsing away suspended substances. This means the amount of backwashing water is largely reduced, compared with most conventional sand filtration devices that require frequent backwashing. In addition, the outflow of exfoliated sludge is drastically reduced, resulting in an overall high cleaning effect. Crushing of the media filter is impossible due to the kneading action of the unit. When sewage water containing organic matter is treated by the conventional filter tanks, filter media can’t keep up and may suffer proper functioning as a result. That’s where MOBILE SIPHON TANK comes in: to prevent fixation and keep media perpetually clean through Siphon Washing Technology. This means washing only has to happen for one minute a day. MST can cut back on about 10% of CO2 emissions in comparison with traditional sand filtration devices. Why? It doesn’t have to get rid of used media, thereby decreasing the amount of backwashing water and electricity consumption necessary. Certified as “Low CO2 Kawasaki Brand” by Kawasaki-city in Japan, MST is a major contributor to compliance with non-polluting zero-emission efforts. V. Track records The Siphon Washing Technology was invented in 1997. Since then, it has been exhibited in major foreign exhibitions, such as IFAT in Germany, Aquatech in the Netherlands, WEFTEC in the US and The Big 5 in UAE. At this time, 100 devices have been applied over the globe, including Japan, German, Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Philippines and Mozambique. VI. International patent Nihon Genryo Co., Ltd.’s Siphon Washing Technology has patents in 33 countries currently.",

    "competitive_advantage": "1. Waste Partitioning Technology and Capacity   Bio Plaza can accept an extensive range of food wastes including organic wastes and plastics. Our partitioning technology can process food wastes without separation beforehand. Productive capacity for processing food wastes into compost is 10 ton per hour. 2. Unique Biological Deodorization Technology   We have developed our own deodorization technology to completely treat and seal odor of food wastes during the recycling process. Because of this, our facility can be located anywhere (i.e. near highway, factories, and office buildings). 3. Environmentally-friendly Treatment Process   Heat generated from fermentation process and heat from sunlight are used to operate fermentation treatment process. By considering global environmental sustainability, we have a policy to use renewable energy as much as possible when needed for the fermentation process. 4. Niche Market for 100% Organic Fertilizer Product   We always receive a good feedback from our existing buyers of the produced compost (100% organic fertilizer) and we see that there is very high demand for our product. For instance, we frequently receive order from our customers more than our facility can product per day. Our product is certified as Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) product. 5. Cost   Our facility can process a quite large amount of food wastes at once, compared to other food waste recycling facilities in Japan today. Our facility significantly reduces cost for recycling food wastes because of the unique processing capacity. For instance, cost of recycling food wastes in our facility is almost a half of that in other food waste recycling facilities currently operated in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.",
    "performance": "Kumamoto Seisosha (Kumasei) started business with general waste and industrial waste collection and transportation. In our past work, we recognized the importance of food recycling when considering whether it was possible to recycle food waste. With this in mind, we have established our own technology to make high quality compost by recycling food waste. The produced compost (100% organic fertilizer) is certified as Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) product. So far we have established two Bio Plaza facilities in Japan. One is in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture, established in 2002, and the other one is in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, established in 2007. For instance, Bio Plaza in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, processes food wastes of 100 ton per day. The amount of compost produced is 22 ton per day. Odor of food waste is well controlled as the composting plants are built in a closed method. By considering global environmental sustainability, we have a policy to use renewable energy as much as possible when needed for processing food wastes with fermentation technology.",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Versatility While common methods can only use dry materials, the Meiwa’s technology can process both wet and dry materials. Examples of wet materials include food waste, animal waste, human waste, and sludge. Dry materials include bamboo, residual wood, saw dust and rice husk. While common methods can only use dry materials, the Meiwa’s technology can process both wet and dry materials. Examples of wet materials include food waste, animal waste, human waste, and sludge. Dry materials include bamboo, residual wood, saw dust and rice husk. Meiwa has installed over 70 biomass carbonization plants for processing various ingredients. Meiwa has installed over 70 biomass carbonization plants for processing various ingredients. II. Energy Efficiency and Cost Efficiency An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  III. Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk. Compared with other organic waste processing methods,  omposting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk. IV. High Processing Capacity The process can produce between 50kg/d and 25t/d, which can be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The yield is between 1/3 and 1/4 of raw material as charcoal. Meiwa Co., Ltd. has delivered more than 70 biomass carbonization plants since 1999, 15 of which went to foreign countries such as China and Vietnam. About 85% of them were large scale plants, while the rest were small- to middle-scale plants (batch type).",
    "applications": "Simply put, biomass carbonization plant is a waste recycling plant that can convert almost anything organic into charcoal (called biochar). Processable materials include sludge, human waste, chicken manure, scrap wood, agricultural residue, food waste and water hyacinth among others. As biochar can work as a natural fertilizer, soil conditioner, fuel etc., Meiwa’s biomass carbonization technology provides solutions to waste management and agriculture, environment and/or energy at the same time.",
    "performance": "Processable materials: Both wet biomass (e.g. sludge, human waste, and animal waste, water hyacinth, food waste etc.) and dry biomass (saw dust, rice husk, residual wood, bamboo, etc.) Output products: Charcoal (biochar) that can be used as a natural fertilizer, soil conditioner and/or fuel Processing capacity: From 50kg/d to 25t/d, adjustable upon client’s request Yield of output products: About 1/3~1/4 of raw material (as charcoal) Optional unit: Drying unit, power generation unit*, wood vinegar harvesting unit*, desulfurization unit, etc. *ingredient-selective",
    "risk": "1.      Intellectual property-related risks Meiwa’s patent covers a specific method of plant operation. Therefore, physically copying the machine alone will not be competitive as such operation will likely require high running costs. Meiwa also supplies core parts from Japan. 2.      Human resources management Meiwa is interested in partnering with the local private sector that wishes to grow business as an agent. Meiwa will make every effort to manage human resources through incentivizing partners by actual sales performance and regularly having online/offline communication. 3.      Finding right partners in local private and public sectors To avoid fraud and other risks with inappropriate partners, Meiwa will first try to meet potential partners introduced by credible parties, such as international organizations, aid agencies, embassies, etc. as well as the ones attending high-level networking events such as TICAD. Meiwa will inquire the business record of foreign companies and project experience with the public sector. Meiwa does not intend to make any exclusive agreements.",

    "competitive_advantage": "Competitive advantage compared to products of competing enterprise (1) Advantages over competitors’ carbonization plants Various processable materials Based on our experience of installing more than 70 biomass carbonization plants, Meiwa has a market-proven method of processing both wet and dry materials, while typical competitors can only deal with dry materials. Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling. However, it is often a problem that the fermentation process requires a long time and the final output is hard to sell for value. Compared to this, our carbonization plant can complete the process within a day and the output is easier to sell (as powerful natural fertilizer/soil conditioner or fuel).",

    "competitive_advantage": "RPPWF™ is a class 4 solid recovered fuel, registered in the international fuel list CEN 343, and is expected to be the promising alternative resource to coal and oil. For example, RPPWF™ has a higher calorific value (over 25MJ/Kg) than coal (generally between 19-22 MJ/Kg). Compared to coal, RPPWF™ has about 20% less moisture and approximately 50% less ash. The content of Sulphur in RPPWF™ is almost negligible while coal generally contains up to about 10%. Furthermore, the CO2 emission from burning RPPWF™ is almost one third, compared to that from burning coal. Because of this ‘green’ characteristics, RPPWF™ is alternatively called Green Coal™ (this name is also a registered trademark). RPPWF™ also has higher biomass contents than conventional biomass resources. In the case of RPPWF™, more than 85% is biomass content (rests are plants or plastics).    RPPWF™ satisfies the European standard for solid recovered fuel, CEN 343, and also has certifications of ISO 14001 and ISO 9001.",
    "performance": "Because the raw materials for RPPWF™ are 100% biomass (i.e. paper, plant and wood wastes), CO2 emission of the procurement of raw materials can be mostly reduced to zero. Moreover, biomass as raw materials means less cost to procure than any other fuel resources such as coal and oil. Heat recovery rate of RPPWF™ is over 70% and the combustion efficiency is about 98% which are much higher than those of coal and oil.   The CO2 emission reduced from producing RPPWF™ can be used for CO2 credit for domestic and/or international emissions trading.   The production process of RPPWF™ is operated with heat-pump technology, a device proving heat through low carbon emission, which further improves the overall emission of the production process.",
    "risk": "Language barrier, law and regulations of candidate countries might become challenges when installing RPPWF™ production line and establishing supply chain network. Climate conditions could affect the long-term reliability of the RPPWF™ production. Good education for operators at the production site must be conducted to maintain the efficiency of RPPWF™ production.",

It is important to note that time to complete the decomposition process from waste plastics to oil is about 5-6 hours (Depending on the quality of waste plastics, it may take longer to complete the process). Batch process system Low tar oil production  High tar oil often causes usage issues for end-users (i.e. clogging of burner nozzle) so low tar oil production is highly regarded. With our plant machine, low tar oil can be produced by selecting a suitable catalyst based on what type of wastes to be treated. Low tar oil production Cost reduction and energy efficiency  Because our plant can be operated with a low fuel consumption, and liquid fuel produced is used as a heat source for the system, it is possible to effectively reduce running cost and energy consumption.

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Versatility While common methods can only use dry materials, the Meiwa’s technology can process both wet and dry materials. Examples of wet materials include food waste, animal waste, human waste, and sludge. Dry materials include bamboo, residual wood, saw dust and rice husk. While common methods can only use dry materials, the Meiwa’s technology can process both wet and dry materials. Examples of wet materials include food waste, animal waste, human waste, and sludge. Dry materials include bamboo, residual wood, saw dust and rice husk. Meiwa has installed over 70 biomass carbonization plants for processing various ingredients. Meiwa has installed over 70 biomass carbonization plants for processing various ingredients. II. Energy Efficiency and Cost Efficiency An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  III. Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk. Compared with other organic waste processing methods,  omposting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk. IV. High Processing Capacity The process can produce between 50kg/d and 25t/d, which can be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The yield is between 1/3 and 1/4 of raw material as charcoal. Meiwa Co., Ltd. has delivered more than 70 biomass carbonization plants since 1999, 15 of which went to foreign countries such as China and Vietnam. About 85% of them were large scale plants, while the rest were small- to middle-scale plants (batch type).",
    "applications": "Simply put, biomass carbonization plant is a waste recycling plant that can convert almost anything organic into charcoal (called biochar). Processable materials include sludge, human waste, chicken manure, scrap wood, agricultural residue, food waste and water hyacinth among others. As biochar can work as a natural fertilizer, soil conditioner, fuel etc., Meiwa’s biomass carbonization technology provides solutions to waste management and agriculture, environment and/or energy at the same time.",
    "performance": "Processable materials: Both wet biomass (e.g. sludge, human waste, and animal waste, water hyacinth, food waste etc.) and dry biomass (saw dust, rice husk, residual wood, bamboo, etc.) Output products: Charcoal (biochar) that can be used as a natural fertilizer, soil conditioner and/or fuel Processing capacity: From 50kg/d to 25t/d, adjustable upon client’s request Yield of output products: About 1/3~1/4 of raw material (as charcoal) Optional unit: Drying unit, power generation unit*, wood vinegar harvesting unit*, desulfurization unit, etc. *ingredient-selective",
    "risk": "1.      Intellectual property-related risks Meiwa’s patent covers a specific method of plant operation. Therefore, physically copying the machine alone will not be competitive as such operation will likely require high running costs. Meiwa also supplies core parts from Japan. 2.      Human resources management Meiwa is interested in partnering with the local private sector that wishes to grow business as an agent. Meiwa will make every effort to manage human resources through incentivizing partners by actual sales performance and regularly having online/offline communication. 3.      Finding right partners in local private and public sectors To avoid fraud and other risks with inappropriate partners, Meiwa will first try to meet potential partners introduced by credible parties, such as international organizations, aid agencies, embassies, etc. as well as the ones attending high-level networking events such as TICAD. Meiwa will inquire the business record of foreign companies and project experience with the public sector. Meiwa does not intend to make any exclusive agreements.",

    "competitive_advantage": "Competitive advantage compared to products of competing enterprise (1) Advantages over competitors’ carbonization plants Various processable materials Based on our experience of installing more than 70 biomass carbonization plants, Meiwa has a market-proven method of processing both wet and dry materials, while typical competitors can only deal with dry materials. Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling. However, it is often a problem that the fermentation process requires a long time and the final output is hard to sell for value. Compared to this, our carbonization plant can complete the process within a day and the output is easier to sell (as powerful natural fertilizer/soil conditioner or fuel).",

High Sensitivity The laser technology provides excellent linearity (which measures 0.0000-2.0000 mg/L turbidity unit) and enables stable and continuous measurement of submicron particles found in water at extremely low concentration. The devices effectively monitor leakage from a membrane filter, which increases the chance of preventing pathogens such as Cryptosporidium contaminating the water. II. Easy Operation The operation of the devices is easy and simple. One can analyze water simply by connecting the device to a flowing water sample. III. Maintenance & Cost No frequent maintenance is required. The devices have a “clean structure,” which resists contamination of a sample cell. The sensors can be easily removed, and the sample cell can be cleaned easily. The laser used in the devices has a long lifetime enabling them to be continuously used for a long time without calibration. The operating cost of the devices is, therefore, low. IV. Examples of Use The devices are suitable for the following; 1) turbidity management at the filtered water outlet to follow countermeasure guidelines for Cryptosporidium etc., 2) as a sensor to detect rupture of filtration membrane in a water purification facility, 3) performance evaluation of a process such as precipitation, activated carbon treatment, and sand filtration, and 4) management of circulating filtered water outlet (e.g. pool water.)

Treatment and processing record from the past 3 years FY 2013: approx. 25,000t (2013.4.1～2014.3.31)  FY 2012: approx. 27,000t (2012.4.1～2013.3.31)  FY 2011: approx. 26,000t (2011.4.1～2012.3.31) Past record of waste imported from abroad Taiwan:  Dry cell batteries, button cell batteries, HID lamps: approx. 3,200t (2006~ 2014.6) Philippines:  Fluorescent lamps: approx. 60t (2002～2014.6) Until now, we have been importing uncrushed lamps from the Philippines and have been treating and recycling the lamps in Japan. However, in 2014, with the support of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) we have established a new recycling scheme for the Philippines. We installed a lamp crusher in the Philippines, thus allowing lamps to be crushed locally. The crushed lamps will be shipped to our facility.  Through this local pre-treatment process, we will be able to reduce the transportation fee, which in turn, will cut the cost of the whole recycling process. Moreover, by setting up a pre-treatment facility, we aim to raise awareness and increase the recycling rate in the Philippines.",

Mercury is recovered through a roasting process. “Roasting” is when we heat an object to the extent where physical or chemical change is created (but without melting it). At Nomura Kohsan, we roast at 600℃~800℃ in order to vaporize the mercury that is contained in the waste. Afterwards, the mercury vapor flows through a cooling tower and a scrubber where it is recovered. Furthermore, to thwart even the smallest trace of mercury from getting into the atmosphere, we have equipped the final process with mercury adsorbent. By properly removing mercury from the waste, other materials from the waste product can be recycled.",
    "performance": "■ For fluorescent lamps ■  Once the lamps are crushed, the metallic bases are removed and the Hg-contaminated glass fragments pass through the washing process. Through this process, Hg-contaminated sludge is collected, which is then sent to the furnace for roasting (for more information on roasting process see “conceivable application”). In addition to this, fluorescent powder (which is collected during the crushing process) contains traces of Hg, so it also goes though the roasting process in order to retrieve mercury. Recovered materials are recycled into the following products:   Mercury ⇒ used in fluorescent lamps, reagent, etc.   Glass ⇒ raw material for: glass wool (fiberglass), glass (for fluorescent lamps), and cement   metallic base ⇒ raw material for aluminum   fluorescent powder ⇒ raw material for rare earth Percentage (of the whole lamp) recycled: nearly 100% ■ For dry-cell batteries ■  Secondary batteries are removed through a two-step process of sorting (shape-based sorting and manual sorting). Afterwards, they are sent to specialized companies for recycling. Only primary batteries are processed at our facility. First, the batteries go through a roasting process in the rotary kiln so that the mercury can be vaporized and recovered. Then, the roasted remnants are pulverized and magnetically separated, isolating the iron scraps from the residual zinc and manganese. Recovered materials are recycled into the following products:  Mercury ⇒ used in fluorescent lamps, reagent, etc.  outer casing (iron scrap) ⇒ raw material for iron  Residual zinc and manganese ⇒ raw material for zinc ingot and micronutrient fertilizer Percentage (of the whole battery) recycled: nearly 100%",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Environmentally Friendly Design  The gas and ash that are discharged from this incinerator are non-hazardous. This is because the dioxin is eliminated as it passes through the two-chamber system. Dust is also removed via a cyclone separator. As such, this slashes the amount of dioxin in the exhaust to less than 0.06ng-TEQ/N (for TDE-RC-50). Clients also have the option of installing a PM2.5 emission control system. II. Compact Design  Due to its compact design, the incinerator can be placed in facilities with limited spaces. This makes it possible for those facilities with small extra spaces to consider having their own in-house waste incineration system. makes it possible for those facilities with small extra spaces to consider having their own in-house waste incineration system.

    "features_and_advantages": "I. Safety and Stability This fully-automated water supply system enables not only safe but also stable water supply. Wellthy’s membrane separation technology takes away the contaminants from raw water and converts it into drinking water that is safe to the consumer. There is little maintenance and operational commitment thanks to its fully automated features. This ensures steady and stable results.   II. Low Start-Up Costs Because this is a decentralized system, there are low initial costs and O&M costs associated with this technology, as compared to larger, more centralized water treatment systems. Operating on a small scale, this water treatment system suits individual business institutions such as hospitals, residential buildings, and shopping centers, installed at the client’s site. No long supply pipelines are necessary and  minimal construction costs are involved. III. Energy Efficient Not as much energy is required, as compared with centralized systems, when it comes to water intake, treatment and supply. IV. Remote Monitoring Operational conditions and water quality data can be accessed from any location, not just on-site. The system can be operated from remote areas, so it is ideal for areas in which access is difficult. Potential applications include large institutions that require large amounts of clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets. This water treatment system is desirable because of its low initial installation cost. More than 1,200 water treatment systems have been installed so far in Japan. Some pilot systems have been rolled out in Kenya, Africa, Vietnam, and Myanmar as well. Wellthy Corporation specializes in providing total engineering to water solutions, including many facets such as plant engineering, operation and maintenance, research and development, and water analysis.",
    "applications": "Wellthy’s water treatment system is a small-scale, on-site water treatment and supply system that utilizes existing water resource at the customer’s compound and treats the water into drinking water that meets the drinking water quality standards. The water source can be groundwater, surface water and water from public supply system. Our water treatment system combines pre-treatment process and membrane separation technology, depending on the quality of the raw water, to remove contaminants such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic.",
    "performance": "We usually design small-scale water treatment and supply systems that have a capacity from 50 to 1,000 m3/day. One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy consumption, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. Also, water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines. 3 As for the water treatment performance, our technology can improve the quality of water to meet the customer’s needs, because we design each system for every client. For example, we operate a system that produces drinking water from raw water with Color: 350 NTU, Turbidity: 62 NTU, Fe: 3.3 mg/L and Mn: 1.8 mg/L, just for your reference.",
    "risk": "Depending on the raw water quality, water treatment process could become more complex. In such case, the operating costs might increase, compared to the basic water treatment process flow, since some extra costs for chemical and waste water treatment as well as electricity would be charged additionally, as indicated below.",
    "modality_of_transaction": "Direct Investment  We are looking for direct business with the customers of our water treatment systems that produce drinking water from groundwater, surface water and city water and so on.   We can either sell the system itself or sell a service package with operation and maintenance to supply safe water continuously. We are also planning to offer a purchase scheme with less financial burden on the customer’s side. Partnership  We are looking for a local business partner or a distributor who would actively support our business of water supply services, water treatment system sales and O&M services of such systems.   When we find a potential partner(s), we will transfer the technology, necessary for the work above. Export of product  We can export our products such as water treatment system packages and related accessories, and also remote monitoring systems.",
    "technical_maturity": "As of June 2015, we have installed more than 1,000 water treatment systems in Japan and operated a few pilot systems in Kenya, Africa and in Vietnam, Southeast Asia.  Picture A: Pilot Systems in Kenya Picture A: Pilot Systems in Kenya    Picture B: Pilot Systems in Vietnam Picture B: Pilot Systems in Vietnam",
    "competitive_advantage": "1. Fully-automated, safe and stable water supply system Our membrane separation technology for water treatment removes contaminants, such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic in raw water. Also, the system is fully automated, hence it ensures safe and stable water supply with minimum maintenance and operational effort. 2. Low initial costs and O&M costs  A “Decentralized” system like our on-site system saves initial costs and O&M costs. Compared to massive, centralized water treatment system, our water treatment systems are small-scale, designed for individual usage, installed within the client’s compound, and thus without long supply pipelines. Therefore, both the initial costs (for the system itself and construction fees) and O&M costs can be minimized. 3. Less energy consumption  One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. 4. Remote monitoring system  Operation data is accessible even from remote areas. Our water treatment system employs a remote monitoring system, which enables you to check the operational conditions and water quality no matter where you are. 5. Low risk for water contamination  Water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines that are considered major source of water contamination. 6. Potential applications  With all the above characteristics, large institutions that need clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets will benefit from introduction of our system.",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. No special tank is needed The system can be installed in a tank made of any materials including concrete, stainless steel, and polyethylene. There is no need to purchase a special tank for the installation. A tank is first filled with unpurified water, and the manual stir pump is placed inside the tank.   II. Amount of Treatable Water The maximum amount of water to be purified in a single tank is five cubic meters (five tons) with a manual stir pump. The manual stir pump is not required when the water purified is a small amount. III. Flocculating Agent A flocculating agent is added to the unpurified water before the water is stirred manually. The amount of the agent must be precise (about 150 to 300 grams/m3 of water). The ingredients of the agent are determined through a water analysis, but they contain a special safe additive produced by Nippon Poly-Glu Co.Ltd. The additive is based on PGα21ca, which is produced using the bacteria called Bacillus natto. IV. Easy-to-Use Manual Stir Pump The manual stir pump used in this system is specially developed by the company. It is durable and comes in different sizes depending on the size of the tank. The operation is easy. Even women, children and elderly can turn the handle. When the handle is turned, water is spiraled up and down with the help of screws. The stirred water dissociates into purified water and sediments. The accumulated sediments can be removed through a valve located at the bottom of the tank. V. Cost Cost depends on the quality of local water to be processed. Local water must be first analyzed for its contents, and the result will be used to determine the material composition of the flocculating agent. The cost of the manual stir pump for a 1,000-liter water tank is 250,000JPY, while that of a flocculating agent per 20kg is from 25,000 to 30,000JPY. VI. Easy Maintenance The entire system is simple and requires little maintenance. The system is currently being used in various countries. In Tanzania, fluoride is removed from the well water so that its quality meets the WHO standards. In Myanmar, the system is used to purify water used in a medical facility.",
    "competitive_advantage": "To the best of our knowledge, there is no company offering a technology at this point that can remove iron, arsenic, and fluorine at a lower cost than our company can.   No need for electric power. Simple device.",
    "technical_maturity": "In Tanzania, fluorine content in the well water often exceeds the standard of the WHO, even when people are careful to select a location to dig a well. We keep making an effort so that people in Tanzania are helped by removing fluorine from the well water. In Myanmar, a Non-Profit Organization requested our company’s help to secure enough water at a medical treatment facility. Our air lift stir machine and flocculating agents successfully operated to secure enough water for medical use, such as washing hands.",

Thus, it can be installed wherever clean water needs to be used, at any time. This makes it easy to use in areas struck by disaster, small villages with no potable water, and other similar situations.  II. No filter media replacement  Filter media can be used on a semi-permanent basis with no need for replacement thanks to Siphon Washing Technology. Disposal of filter media as industrial waste is no longer a concern, as a result. SIPHON TANK is \"earth-friendly\" filtration device that significantly contributes to a response to ISO14000. III. Reduce backwashed water The need for backwashing water is drastically reduced, thanks to Siphon Washing Technology that efficiently takes away suspended substances. This means backwashing is only needed for rinsing off those suspended substances. This is a drastic reduction when compared with traditional sand filtration devices, which all require frequent backwashing and therefore create waste. IV. No fixation of filter media With the use of NEST, there is no fixation and thus the filter media stays clean. When sewage water containing lots of organic matter is treated by conventional filter tanks, filter media can’t filter properly. With this equipment, this is no longer a concern. Media is therefore always kept clean thanks to Siphon Washing Technology, which washes for just one minute each day. From compact design and easy operation to low cost of operation and maintenance, the Non-Electric SIPHON TANK (NEST) by Nihon Genryo Co., Ltd. carries many benefit in today’s society.",

No filter media replacement Filter media can be used semi-permanently without the need for replacement, with zero need for disposal of dirty, used filter media as industrial waste. Earth-friendly, this filtration device significantly adheres to requirements set forth by ISO14000. In line with environmental standards, MST is safe for use in many applications. MST is able to remove suspended substances via Siphon Washing Technology, conducting backwashing only as needed for rinsing away suspended substances. This means the amount of backwashing water is largely reduced, compared with most conventional sand filtration devices that require frequent backwashing. In addition, the outflow of exfoliated sludge is drastically reduced, resulting in an overall high cleaning effect. Crushing of the media filter is impossible due to the kneading action of the unit. When sewage water containing organic matter is treated by the conventional filter tanks, filter media can’t keep up and may suffer proper functioning as a result. That’s where MOBILE SIPHON TANK comes in: to prevent fixation and keep media perpetually clean through Siphon Washing Technology. This means washing only has to happen for one minute a day. MST can cut back on about 10% of CO2 emissions in comparison with traditional sand filtration devices. Why? It doesn’t have to get rid of used media, thereby decreasing the amount of backwashing water and electricity consumption necessary. Certified as “Low CO2 Kawasaki Brand” by Kawasaki-city in Japan, MST is a major contributor to compliance with non-polluting zero-emission efforts. V. Track records The Siphon Washing Technology was invented in 1997. Since then, it has been exhibited in major foreign exhibitions, such as IFAT in Germany, Aquatech in the Netherlands, WEFTEC in the US and The Big 5 in UAE.

An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  III. Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk.

    "competitive_advantage": "Competitive advantage compared to products of competing enterprise (1) Advantages over competitors’ carbonization plants Various processable materials Based on our experience of installing more than 70 biomass carbonization plants, Meiwa has a market-proven method of processing both wet and dry materials, while typical competitors can only deal with dry materials. Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling. However, it is often a problem that the fermentation process requires a long time and the final output is hard to sell for value. Compared to this, our carbonization plant can complete the process within a day and the output is easier to sell (as powerful natural fertilizer/soil conditioner or fuel).",

    "features_and_advantages": "I. Safety and Stability This fully-automated water supply system enables not only safe but also stable water supply. Wellthy’s membrane separation technology takes away the contaminants from raw water and converts it into drinking water that is safe to the consumer. There is little maintenance and operational commitment thanks to its fully automated features. This ensures steady and stable results.   II. Low Start-Up Costs Because this is a decentralized system, there are low initial costs and O&M costs associated with this technology, as compared to larger, more centralized water treatment systems. Operating on a small scale, this water treatment system suits individual business institutions such as hospitals, residential buildings, and shopping centers, installed at the client’s site. No long supply pipelines are necessary and  minimal construction costs are involved. III. Energy Efficient Not as much energy is required, as compared with centralized systems, when it comes to water intake, treatment and supply. IV. Remote Monitoring Operational conditions and water quality data can be accessed from any location, not just on-site. The system can be operated from remote areas, so it is ideal for areas in which access is difficult. Potential applications include large institutions that require large amounts of clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets. This water treatment system is desirable because of its low initial installation cost. More than 1,200 water treatment systems have been installed so far in Japan. Some pilot systems have been rolled out in Kenya, Africa, Vietnam, and Myanmar as well. Wellthy Corporation specializes in providing total engineering to water solutions, including many facets such as plant engineering, operation and maintenance, research and development, and water analysis.",
    "applications": "Wellthy’s water treatment system is a small-scale, on-site water treatment and supply system that utilizes existing water resource at the customer’s compound and treats the water into drinking water that meets the drinking water quality standards. The water source can be groundwater, surface water and water from public supply system. Our water treatment system combines pre-treatment process and membrane separation technology, depending on the quality of the raw water, to remove contaminants such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic.",
    "performance": "We usually design small-scale water treatment and supply systems that have a capacity from 50 to 1,000 m3/day. One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy consumption, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. Also, water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines. 3 As for the water treatment performance, our technology can improve the quality of water to meet the customer’s needs, because we design each system for every client. For example, we operate a system that produces drinking water from raw water with Color: 350 NTU, Turbidity: 62 NTU, Fe: 3.3 mg/L and Mn: 1.8 mg/L, just for your reference.",
    "risk": "Depending on the raw water quality, water treatment process could become more complex. In such case, the operating costs might increase, compared to the basic water treatment process flow, since some extra costs for chemical and waste water treatment as well as electricity would be charged additionally, as indicated below.",
    "modality_of_transaction": "Direct Investment  We are looking for direct business with the customers of our water treatment systems that produce drinking water from groundwater, surface water and city water and so on.   We can either sell the system itself or sell a service package with operation and maintenance to supply safe water continuously. We are also planning to offer a purchase scheme with less financial burden on the customer’s side. Partnership  We are looking for a local business partner or a distributor who would actively support our business of water supply services, water treatment system sales and O&M services of such systems.   When we find a potential partner(s), we will transfer the technology, necessary for the work above. Export of product  We can export our products such as water treatment system packages and related accessories, and also remote monitoring systems.",
    "technical_maturity": "As of June 2015, we have installed more than 1,000 water treatment systems in Japan and operated a few pilot systems in Kenya, Africa and in Vietnam, Southeast Asia.  Picture A: Pilot Systems in Kenya Picture A: Pilot Systems in Kenya    Picture B: Pilot Systems in Vietnam Picture B: Pilot Systems in Vietnam",
    "competitive_advantage": "1. Fully-automated, safe and stable water supply system Our membrane separation technology for water treatment removes contaminants, such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic in raw water. Also, the system is fully automated, hence it ensures safe and stable water supply with minimum maintenance and operational effort. 2. Low initial costs and O&M costs  A “Decentralized” system like our on-site system saves initial costs and O&M costs. Compared to massive, centralized water treatment system, our water treatment systems are small-scale, designed for individual usage, installed within the client’s compound, and thus without long supply pipelines. Therefore, both the initial costs (for the system itself and construction fees) and O&M costs can be minimized. 3. Less energy consumption  One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. 4. Remote monitoring system  Operation data is accessible even from remote areas. Our water treatment system employs a remote monitoring system, which enables you to check the operational conditions and water quality no matter where you are. 5. Low risk for water contamination  Water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines that are considered major source of water contamination. 6. Potential applications  With all the above characteristics, large institutions that need clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets will benefit from introduction of our system.",

This has been a long-time concern of farmers, who realize that clogs happen all too frequently, wasting time and valuable resources. However, thanks to a wider water passage and self-cleaning mechanism, uniform irrigation over the long-term can be achieved. This drip tube, called Microdrip 8, can last up to three years and beyond, with changing necessitated by shifts in water quality and climate conditions. II. Direct irrigation to the root zone With simple drip irrigation, farmers apply water and fertilizer directly to the root zone. As a result, the up-take of water and fertilizer is higher than with flood irrigation. In addition, with this method, the root is able to grow actively with proper maintenance of moisture and air within the root zone. Thus, there is vast improvement in crop productivity and yield. More crops equal more income as well as preservation of natural resources. III. Self-cleaning mechanism This technology includes a self-cleaning mechanism for convenience and time savings in maintenance. Netafim Japan Co., Ltd. plans to release this system in a phased manner as it expands its water/fertilizer saving micro irrigation system products.",

    "competitive_advantage": "[Enhance agricultural productivity and improves the quality] The water, filtered by the HIET, increases productivity of crops (e.g. rice, strawberries, sweet potatoes and pumpkins), and improves the quality of such agricultural products. [No maintenance required] The function of the “HIET” lasts almost permanently, and no maintenance is required. Thus, no operation cost would be required. [Reduce application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides] With water, filtered through the HIET, agricultural products grows without using chemical fertilizers and pesticides, or only with a small amount, so you can significantly reduce such chemical inputs for agriculture production. Not using chemical fertilizers and pesticides, you can assure the safety of the food quality, which benefits the people's health. Besides, it will be cost effective.",
    "performance": "<Equipment comparison> 1. The number of free molecules in water, filtered through the “HIET”, is 2.5 times more than       that in tap water. 2. If you apply other similar equipment, the amount of free molecules in the water (e.g. general       magnetic water) would be reduced by half within 40 minutes, while free water molecules,      formed by the “HIET”, would stay free longer and continuously deliver a positive impact. <Equipment performance> Growth enhancement and cleansing effect for agricultural and livestock products =>The water, filtered by the HIET, achieves a high thermal diffusivity and increases water permeability. As water permeability is higher, microorganisms in the soil will be able to assimilate more water. As the leaf cells can absorb more water, the rate of photosynthesis will grow. As a result, the harvest quality will be improved.",

Meiwa has installed over 70 biomass carbonization plants for processing various ingredients. II. Energy Efficiency and Cost Efficiency An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  III. Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk.

Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk. IV. High Processing Capacity The process can produce between 50kg/d and 25t/d, which can be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The yield is between 1/3 and 1/4 of raw material as charcoal. Meiwa Co., Ltd. has delivered more than 70 biomass carbonization plants since 1999, 15 of which went to foreign countries such as China and Vietnam. About 85% of them were large scale plants, while the rest were small- to middle-scale plants (batch type).",
    "applications": "Simply put, biomass carbonization plant is a waste recycling plant that can convert almost anything organic into charcoal (called biochar). Processable materials include sludge, human waste, chicken manure, scrap wood, agricultural residue, food waste and water hyacinth among others. As biochar can work as a natural fertilizer, soil conditioner, fuel etc., Meiwa’s biomass carbonization technology provides solutions to waste management and agriculture, environment and/or energy at the same time.",

    "risk": "1.      Intellectual property-related risks Meiwa’s patent covers a specific method of plant operation. Therefore, physically copying the machine alone will not be competitive as such operation will likely require high running costs. Meiwa also supplies core parts from Japan. 2.      Human resources management Meiwa is interested in partnering with the local private sector that wishes to grow business as an agent. Meiwa will make every effort to manage human resources through incentivizing partners by actual sales performance and regularly having online/offline communication. 3.      Finding right partners in local private and public sectors To avoid fraud and other risks with inappropriate partners, Meiwa will first try to meet potential partners introduced by credible parties, such as international organizations, aid agencies, embassies, etc. as well as the ones attending high-level networking events such as TICAD. Meiwa will inquire the business record of foreign companies and project experience with the public sector. Meiwa does not intend to make any exclusive agreements.",

Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling. However, it is often a problem that the fermentation process requires a long time and the final output is hard to sell for value. Compared to this, our carbonization plant can complete the process within a day and the output is easier to sell (as powerful natural fertilizer/soil conditioner or fuel).",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Strains Can Tolerate High Sugar Concentration I. Strains Can Tolerate High Sugar Concentration The special strains that the company has proposed can tolerate in solutions with higher sugar concentration. In general, the initial sugar concentration required for fermentation is about 16%. Higher sugar concentration can kill a majority of cells partly due to osmotic pressure. The special strains can, however, tolerate in a solution of up to about 30%. With the special strains, therefore, a larger volume of sugar can be processed in a single batch. II. Fewer Impurities II. Fewer Impurities The final product, ethanol, has low levels of impurities. Therefore, distillation process is simplified whether the ethanol is used for human consumption or used for fuel. For example, a common impurity, methanol, has to be removed before being distributed as it is toxic to human. Fewer impurities also contribute to better fuel efficiency. III. Resistance to High Temperature The special strains of yeast can tolerate up to about 38℃ while normal fermentation temperature is about 32℃. This heat resistance is particularly beneficial when fermentation tanks are located in the areas of high temperature because cooling of the tanks, which requires costly water and energy, is not necessary. IV. Ability to Convert C5 Sugars The proposed strains are genetically modified so that they can consume and ferment C5 sugars such as xylose and arabinose. For this reason, different types of C5 sugars such as cellulosic materials can be used for fermentation. V. Yeast Activities in Molasses In addition to sugars, molasses from sugarcane and beets is also used for fermentation. However, molasses contains minerals and other organic matter. The exact composition of the minerals and organic matter depends on the soil environment where the sugarcane and beets are grown, but they are considered to inhibit the activity of yeast. The activity of the special strains is currently being investigated at Kyushu University. After fermentation, its residues can also be converted to high-quality animal feed and organic fertilizers. The residues contain dead yeast cells that are highly nutritious. Making use of this residue can also help reduce the amount of waste material to be treated and removed from the facility.",
    "competitive_advantage": "Our strains of yeasts have several advantages compared to wild-type strains. 1. Active in high sugar concentrations  The initial concentration of the solution containing molasses/sugars that are to be fermented are generally agreed to be about 16% by solids. This is partly due to the osmotic pressure that is applied on the yeasts at inoculation, which kills the majority of the cells. Our strains, however, are able to tolerate higher concentrations of sugars, up to approximately 30%. This means that larger volumes of sugars can be processed, either in a single or continuously fed batches. 2. Low levels of impurities  Regardless of how the final ethanol is used, low levels of impurities are desirable as it would simplify the distillation process, and allow the final ethanol to be used in a wider range of products. Methanol, for example, is a common impurity found in fermented alcohol and is toxic to humans. Extra measures would therefore be needed in place if the distilled ethanol is to be used as a beverage additive, and may not make the ethanol suitable for human consumption in certain situations. Fewer impurities would also be desirable for ethanol to be used as fuel, as it would burn cleaner and have better fuel efficiency. 3. Resistance to high temperatures  As mentioned earlier, our yeasts were able to ferment sugars into alcohol efficiently up to about 38°C. As the normal fermentation temperature is about 32°C, this is particularly beneficial if the production facilities are located in hot areas, as the fermentation tanks do not need a cooling mechanism. Cooling the tanks require water and energy, which are added costs and resources that can drive up production costs. 4. Ability to convert C5 sugars (xylose & arabinose)  The proposed strain has been genetically modified to allow the yeast to consume and ferment C5 sugars such as xylose and arabinose. Although these sugars are not commonly found in molasses (only C6 sugars), this ability will diversify the types of feedstock that can be used at the facility. This will also be beneficial in the future should the facility turn to diversify its feedstock to include cellulosic materials, which contain C5 sugars. 5. Uninhibited by impurities found in molasses  Other than sugars that can be converted into ethanol, molasses also contains minerals and other organic matter that cannot be utilized in the fermentation process. Although the exact composition varies depending on the soil environment where the sugarcane/beets are grown, it is hypothesized that the activity of yeasts are somehow inhibited by these extra compounds. As our yeast performs very well compared to other strains of yeasts, research is underway at Kyushu University to determine whether if any compounds do inhibit yeast activity, and whether or not our yeasts are unaffected by them.",
    "technical_maturity": "“bits” has a lot of experience using yeasts in the production of bio-ethanol. The latest project was the “Soft Cellulose Utilization Project”, which was funded by Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF). The 4-year project involved converting cellulosic biomass (rice straws) into sugar solutions, and fermenting it to produce ethanol. The fermentation process used in this project is an adaptation of the conventional Japanese sake-making method that has been used for many centuries. Regarding the yeasts themselves, several studies have been done at the University of Miyazaki, Ehime University and Kyushu University to evaluate their efficiency in alcohol fermentation. Strains with superior fermentation performance have been selected, and genetic modifications have been done increase the types of sugars that the yeast can utilize. The tolerance of our yeasts to high temperatures (above the ideal fermentation temperature of 32°C) has been tested in collaboration with the Starch Technology Center at the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi, BPPT) in Indonesia. The tests were conducted by using molasses as the sugar source. The results showed that the yeasts were able to ferment about 80% of the sugars into alcohol efficiently up to about 38°C. The fermented ethanol contained low amounts of impurities such as methanol.",

    "risk": "Contamination  Sterile and sanitary conditions are required for the yeast to propagate and to convert the sugar source into ethanol.

If clean water is not available, then facilities to treat the water must be built to fulfil the water supply need.

    "competitive_advantage": "1. Waste Partitioning Technology and Capacity   Bio Plaza can accept an extensive range of food wastes including organic wastes and plastics. Our partitioning technology can process food wastes without separation beforehand. Productive capacity for processing food wastes into compost is 10 ton per hour. 2. Unique Biological Deodorization Technology   We have developed our own deodorization technology to completely treat and seal odor of food wastes during the recycling process. Because of this, our facility can be located anywhere (i.e. near highway, factories, and office buildings). 3. Environmentally-friendly Treatment Process   Heat generated from fermentation process and heat from sunlight are used to operate fermentation treatment process. By considering global environmental sustainability, we have a policy to use renewable energy as much as possible when needed for the fermentation process. 4. Niche Market for 100% Organic Fertilizer Product   We always receive a good feedback from our existing buyers of the produced compost (100% organic fertilizer) and we see that there is very high demand for our product. For instance, we frequently receive order from our customers more than our facility can product per day. Our product is certified as Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) product. 5. Cost   Our facility can process a quite large amount of food wastes at once, compared to other food waste recycling facilities in Japan today. Our facility significantly reduces cost for recycling food wastes because of the unique processing capacity. For instance, cost of recycling food wastes in our facility is almost a half of that in other food waste recycling facilities currently operated in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.",
    "performance": "Kumamoto Seisosha (Kumasei) started business with general waste and industrial waste collection and transportation. In our past work, we recognized the importance of food recycling when considering whether it was possible to recycle food waste. With this in mind, we have established our own technology to make high quality compost by recycling food waste. The produced compost (100% organic fertilizer) is certified as Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) product. So far we have established two Bio Plaza facilities in Japan. One is in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture, established in 2002, and the other one is in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, established in 2007. For instance, Bio Plaza in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, processes food wastes of 100 ton per day. The amount of compost produced is 22 ton per day. Odor of food waste is well controlled as the composting plants are built in a closed method. By considering global environmental sustainability, we have a policy to use renewable energy as much as possible when needed for processing food wastes with fermentation technology.",
    "risk": "Because our facility involves the use of natural providence (i.e. organic food waste), it is sometimes difficult to operate and maintain the amount of food wastes to be recycled and the amount of compost to be produced.

Meiwa has installed over 70 biomass carbonization plants for processing various ingredients. II. Energy Efficiency and Cost Efficiency An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  III. Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk.

Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk. IV. High Processing Capacity The process can produce between 50kg/d and 25t/d, which can be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The yield is between 1/3 and 1/4 of raw material as charcoal. Meiwa Co., Ltd. has delivered more than 70 biomass carbonization plants since 1999, 15 of which went to foreign countries such as China and Vietnam. About 85% of them were large scale plants, while the rest were small- to middle-scale plants (batch type).",
    "applications": "Simply put, biomass carbonization plant is a waste recycling plant that can convert almost anything organic into charcoal (called biochar). Processable materials include sludge, human waste, chicken manure, scrap wood, agricultural residue, food waste and water hyacinth among others.

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Strains Can Tolerate High Sugar Concentration I. Strains Can Tolerate High Sugar Concentration The special strains that the company has proposed can tolerate in solutions with higher sugar concentration. In general, the initial sugar concentration required for fermentation is about 16%. Higher sugar concentration can kill a majority of cells partly due to osmotic pressure. The special strains can, however, tolerate in a solution of up to about 30%. With the special strains, therefore, a larger volume of sugar can be processed in a single batch. II. Fewer Impurities II. Fewer Impurities The final product, ethanol, has low levels of impurities. Therefore, distillation process is simplified whether the ethanol is used for human consumption or used for fuel. For example, a common impurity, methanol, has to be removed before being distributed as it is toxic to human. Fewer impurities also contribute to better fuel efficiency. III. Resistance to High Temperature The special strains of yeast can tolerate up to about 38℃ while normal fermentation temperature is about 32℃. This heat resistance is particularly beneficial when fermentation tanks are located in the areas of high temperature because cooling of the tanks, which requires costly water and energy, is not necessary. IV. Ability to Convert C5 Sugars The proposed strains are genetically modified so that they can consume and ferment C5 sugars such as xylose and arabinose. For this reason, different types of C5 sugars such as cellulosic materials can be used for fermentation. V. Yeast Activities in Molasses In addition to sugars, molasses from sugarcane and beets is also used for fermentation. However, molasses contains minerals and other organic matter. The exact composition of the minerals and organic matter depends on the soil environment where the sugarcane and beets are grown, but they are considered to inhibit the activity of yeast. The activity of the special strains is currently being investigated at Kyushu University. After fermentation, its residues can also be converted to high-quality animal feed and organic fertilizers. The residues contain dead yeast cells that are highly nutritious. Making use of this residue can also help reduce the amount of waste material to be treated and removed from the facility.",
    "competitive_advantage": "Our strains of yeasts have several advantages compared to wild-type strains. 1. Active in high sugar concentrations  The initial concentration of the solution containing molasses/sugars that are to be fermented are generally agreed to be about 16% by solids. This is partly due to the osmotic pressure that is applied on the yeasts at inoculation, which kills the majority of the cells. Our strains, however, are able to tolerate higher concentrations of sugars, up to approximately 30%. This means that larger volumes of sugars can be processed, either in a single or continuously fed batches. 2. Low levels of impurities  Regardless of how the final ethanol is used, low levels of impurities are desirable as it would simplify the distillation process, and allow the final ethanol to be used in a wider range of products. Methanol, for example, is a common impurity found in fermented alcohol and is toxic to humans. Extra measures would therefore be needed in place if the distilled ethanol is to be used as a beverage additive, and may not make the ethanol suitable for human consumption in certain situations. Fewer impurities would also be desirable for ethanol to be used as fuel, as it would burn cleaner and have better fuel efficiency. 3. Resistance to high temperatures  As mentioned earlier, our yeasts were able to ferment sugars into alcohol efficiently up to about 38°C. As the normal fermentation temperature is about 32°C, this is particularly beneficial if the production facilities are located in hot areas, as the fermentation tanks do not need a cooling mechanism. Cooling the tanks require water and energy, which are added costs and resources that can drive up production costs. 4. Ability to convert C5 sugars (xylose & arabinose)  The proposed strain has been genetically modified to allow the yeast to consume and ferment C5 sugars such as xylose and arabinose. Although these sugars are not commonly found in molasses (only C6 sugars), this ability will diversify the types of feedstock that can be used at the facility. This will also be beneficial in the future should the facility turn to diversify its feedstock to include cellulosic materials, which contain C5 sugars. 5. Uninhibited by impurities found in molasses  Other than sugars that can be converted into ethanol, molasses also contains minerals and other organic matter that cannot be utilized in the fermentation process. Although the exact composition varies depending on the soil environment where the sugarcane/beets are grown, it is hypothesized that the activity of yeasts are somehow inhibited by these extra compounds. As our yeast performs very well compared to other strains of yeasts, research is underway at Kyushu University to determine whether if any compounds do inhibit yeast activity, and whether or not our yeasts are unaffected by them.",
    "technical_maturity": "“bits” has a lot of experience using yeasts in the production of bio-ethanol. The latest project was the “Soft Cellulose Utilization Project”, which was funded by Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF). The 4-year project involved converting cellulosic biomass (rice straws) into sugar solutions, and fermenting it to produce ethanol. The fermentation process used in this project is an adaptation of the conventional Japanese sake-making method that has been used for many centuries. Regarding the yeasts themselves, several studies have been done at the University of Miyazaki, Ehime University and Kyushu University to evaluate their efficiency in alcohol fermentation. Strains with superior fermentation performance have been selected, and genetic modifications have been done increase the types of sugars that the yeast can utilize. The tolerance of our yeasts to high temperatures (above the ideal fermentation temperature of 32°C) has been tested in collaboration with the Starch Technology Center at the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi, BPPT) in Indonesia. The tests were conducted by using molasses as the sugar source. The results showed that the yeasts were able to ferment about 80% of the sugars into alcohol efficiently up to about 38°C. The fermented ethanol contained low amounts of impurities such as methanol.",

    "risk": "Contamination  Sterile and sanitary conditions are required for the yeast to propagate and to convert the sugar source into ethanol.

If clean water is not available, then facilities to treat the water must be built to fulfil the water supply need.

An inner insulation layer provides extra thermal control. 4) Ethylene gas breakdown and antimicrobial contamination.  Destroys the ethylene gas that causes food deterioration, and prevents the growth of microorganisms that otherwise would grow inside the box and on the food. As a result, food is kept fresh and transported for long distances with no need for cooling by electricity. ◆Effect of ethylene gas breakdown on vegetables’ freshness  ◆Figure: Current foam box (blue) vs Dream Box (red) for temperature changes.

    "features_and_advantages": "I. Safety and Stability This fully-automated water supply system enables not only safe but also stable water supply. Wellthy’s membrane separation technology takes away the contaminants from raw water and converts it into drinking water that is safe to the consumer. There is little maintenance and operational commitment thanks to its fully automated features. This ensures steady and stable results.   II. Low Start-Up Costs Because this is a decentralized system, there are low initial costs and O&M costs associated with this technology, as compared to larger, more centralized water treatment systems. Operating on a small scale, this water treatment system suits individual business institutions such as hospitals, residential buildings, and shopping centers, installed at the client’s site. No long supply pipelines are necessary and  minimal construction costs are involved. III. Energy Efficient Not as much energy is required, as compared with centralized systems, when it comes to water intake, treatment and supply. IV. Remote Monitoring Operational conditions and water quality data can be accessed from any location, not just on-site. The system can be operated from remote areas, so it is ideal for areas in which access is difficult. Potential applications include large institutions that require large amounts of clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets. This water treatment system is desirable because of its low initial installation cost. More than 1,200 water treatment systems have been installed so far in Japan. Some pilot systems have been rolled out in Kenya, Africa, Vietnam, and Myanmar as well. Wellthy Corporation specializes in providing total engineering to water solutions, including many facets such as plant engineering, operation and maintenance, research and development, and water analysis.",
    "applications": "Wellthy’s water treatment system is a small-scale, on-site water treatment and supply system that utilizes existing water resource at the customer’s compound and treats the water into drinking water that meets the drinking water quality standards. The water source can be groundwater, surface water and water from public supply system. Our water treatment system combines pre-treatment process and membrane separation technology, depending on the quality of the raw water, to remove contaminants such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic.",
    "performance": "We usually design small-scale water treatment and supply systems that have a capacity from 50 to 1,000 m3/day. One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy consumption, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. Also, water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines. 3 As for the water treatment performance, our technology can improve the quality of water to meet the customer’s needs, because we design each system for every client. For example, we operate a system that produces drinking water from raw water with Color: 350 NTU, Turbidity: 62 NTU, Fe: 3.3 mg/L and Mn: 1.8 mg/L, just for your reference.",
    "risk": "Depending on the raw water quality, water treatment process could become more complex. In such case, the operating costs might increase, compared to the basic water treatment process flow, since some extra costs for chemical and waste water treatment as well as electricity would be charged additionally, as indicated below.",
    "modality_of_transaction": "Direct Investment  We are looking for direct business with the customers of our water treatment systems that produce drinking water from groundwater, surface water and city water and so on.   We can either sell the system itself or sell a service package with operation and maintenance to supply safe water continuously. We are also planning to offer a purchase scheme with less financial burden on the customer’s side. Partnership  We are looking for a local business partner or a distributor who would actively support our business of water supply services, water treatment system sales and O&M services of such systems.   When we find a potential partner(s), we will transfer the technology, necessary for the work above. Export of product  We can export our products such as water treatment system packages and related accessories, and also remote monitoring systems.",

Fully-automated, safe and stable water supply system Our membrane separation technology for water treatment removes contaminants, such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic in raw water. Also, the system is fully automated, hence it ensures safe and stable water supply with minimum maintenance and operational effort. 2. Low initial costs and O&M costs  A “Decentralized” system like our on-site system saves initial costs and O&M costs. Compared to massive, centralized water treatment system, our water treatment systems are small-scale, designed for individual usage, installed within the client’s compound, and thus without long supply pipelines. Therefore, both the initial costs (for the system itself and construction fees) and O&M costs can be minimized. 3. Less energy consumption  One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. 4. Remote monitoring system  Operation data is accessible even from remote areas. Our water treatment system employs a remote monitoring system, which enables you to check the operational conditions and water quality no matter where you are. 5. Low risk for water contamination  Water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines that are considered major source of water contamination. 6. Potential applications  With all the above characteristics, large institutions that need clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets will benefit from introduction of our system.",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Various Use FUMIN COATING can be applied to any types of glass, including wire glass, curved glass, large glass, and frosted glass and polycarbonate, which cannot be film-coated. The agent is a perfect solution for car windows that are made of both glass and polycarbonate. It can be used both indoors and outdoors. II. Visibility Great visibility can be achieved with FUMIN COATING. It forms a layer of 1.5 microns thick. With conventional coating agents that are applied with a sponge, brush, or roller, visibility is compromised because they form a layer of 7 to 10 microns thick and the layer may not be evenly formed. The visible light transmission of FUMIN COATING is about 85% so that appearance and interior brightness are not likely to be affected. III. Bug Repellent FUMIN COATING works as a bug repellent. It keeps glass surfaces from insects with compound eyes such as moths, horse-flies, bees, and stink bugs. These insects tend to fly towards ultraviolet rays that are given off by fluorescent lamps near glass. FUMIN COATING blocks UV-rays to keep these bugs away. IV. Save Heating Energy A glass coated with FUMIN COATING absorbs heat (far infrared ray). If FUMIN COATING is applied on a car windshield and windows, heat is kept inside the car. A 2℃ drop in temperature is considered to save 20% of energy. The agent helps saving energy and is good for the environment. V. Long-lasting Protection FUMIN COATING remains effective for ten years. Unlike other similar products, frequent re-coating is not required. FUMIN COATING resists heat crack as it expands in the same ratio as glasses. It also resists scratches by providing hardness to a glass surface. VI. Prevent Formation of Water Droplets If outside temperature is 15 degrees cooler than inside, a coated glass may look foggy. However, water droplets would not be seen on a glass coated with FUMIN COATING. FUMIN COATING works as an antimicrobial agent by preventing condensation, which promotes bacterial growth. FUMIN Co., Ltd. has successfully invented the spray coating agent to form an ultra-thin transparent layer with many advantages. FUMIN COATING is patented both in Japan and other countries.",
    "competitive_advantage": "Extremely clear visibility after applying FUMIN COATINGTM is because it is forming ultra thin transparent film of 1.5 microns thickness. It is possible to apply on big size, curved or bumpy surface glasses and polycarbonate etc. It is patented ultimate spray coating technology and a perfect solution for car window both with glass and polycarbonate. Although similar coating applications are available with sponge, brush or roller, forming flabby or blurred film of approx. 7–10 microns thickness by such methods, the visibility through glass is obviously degraded to poor. These are impossible to apply on big size, curved or bumpy surface glasses. It has been believed that only vacuum deposition method makes possible to form a transparent thin-film as normal spray coating is for painting colors and not possible to have a transparent finish with such equipment. We successfully invented the method of forming ultra thin transparent film with a commercially available spray gun, and then the Patent has been granted in Japan following by various countries.",
    "technical_maturity": "Number of construction5000  Track record years10 years  Fumin coating was selected for The National Art Center, Tokyo by recommendation from world famous Japanese architects to provide comfort to visitors and art lovers. We completed this project of 4,700 square meters glasses within two weeks. In the section of schematic illustration, a picture of the National Art Center is shown.  In cases in Singapore, it was verified that this technology reduced the temperature within an elevator by 2 degree Celsius. A reduction of heat by 2 degree Celsius is said to be an energy saving of 20%. If we coated the window panes of buildings in the areas of the world where sunlight is intense by employing people for the work as a job-creation measure, an approximately 20% energy saving would be attained semipermanently.",

The inner insulation layer also provides extra thermal control. III. Ethylene Gas Absorption to Prevent Food Deterioration III. Ethylene Gas Absorption to Prevent Food Deterioration The inner coating quickly absorbs and destroys the ethylene gas responsible for food deterioration, thereby preventing the growth of microorganisms that could proliferate inside the box and on the food itself. This helps to keep vegetables, fruits and seafood fresh for the duration of transportation.

    "competitive_advantage": "There is no competition in the market we know of.  Current methods include either using a refrigerator van for transportation or processing the food in specialized factories before transporting it.   New users of our system are shifting from the two abovementioned methods to the Dream Box.  ●Cost  1) Layers with minimal thickness are based on cutting-edge nanotechnology.  Only a few materials are required to keep the cost low. 2) All the coatings are water-based. There are no solvents.  There is no need for a special room in which to apply the coatings.  These products are categorized as nondangerous substances, making the exporting and importing costs very low. 3) Only an ordinary foam box is required.  Local production is easy. 4) Lightweight  Coatings are thin and light to match the advantages of a foam box. 5) There is no need to install electricity to maintain the temperature. ●Durability  The layers are all inorganic, and performance will remain intact unless physical damage occurs to the construction. ●Environmentally friendly  Since no electricity is required and less energy is used to keep the contents fresh or cool, the emission of greenhouse gases can be reduced dramatically.",

    "applications": "1) Food transport  Food (fruits, vegetables, seafood, etc.) is kept fresh for longer periods and free from contamination. This allows consumers access to fresh food, regardless of the distance and time covered from the production area to the consumer.  2) Medical Transport  Temperature control (without using electricity) during the transportation of medicine keeps it safe from deterioration.  This is an extremely important aspect of the system, especially in hot climates where efficient transportation is not really affordable.",
    "performance": "The example for food transport shows here a definite advantage in the length of cooling time that keeps food fresh. Whereas current systems dramatically “heat up” after 15 hours, our proposed “Dream Box” system “keeps cool” for as long as 48 hours. Four unique main features: 1) Antimicrobial contamination and antipollution (outside)  An antistatic function repels dirt from the surface, and the catalytic effect destroys microorganisms. 2) Thermal insulation and protection against (infrared) sun rays (outside)  Reflects sun rays and prevents the temperature from increasing in the box 3) Ethylene gas absorption and thermal insulation (inside)  Ethylene gas is quickly absorbed to prevent food from deteriorating.  An inner insulation layer provides extra thermal control. 4) Ethylene gas breakdown and antimicrobial contamination.  Destroys the ethylene gas that causes food deterioration, and prevents the growth of microorganisms that otherwise would grow inside the box and on the food. As a result, food is kept fresh and transported for long distances with no need for cooling by electricity. ◆Effect of ethylene gas breakdown on vegetables’ freshness  ◆Figure: Current foam box (blue) vs Dream Box (red) for temperature changes.

    "features_and_advantages": "I. Safety and Stability This fully-automated water supply system enables not only safe but also stable water supply. Wellthy’s membrane separation technology takes away the contaminants from raw water and converts it into drinking water that is safe to the consumer. There is little maintenance and operational commitment thanks to its fully automated features. This ensures steady and stable results.   II. Low Start-Up Costs Because this is a decentralized system, there are low initial costs and O&M costs associated with this technology, as compared to larger, more centralized water treatment systems. Operating on a small scale, this water treatment system suits individual business institutions such as hospitals, residential buildings, and shopping centers, installed at the client’s site. No long supply pipelines are necessary and  minimal construction costs are involved. III. Energy Efficient Not as much energy is required, as compared with centralized systems, when it comes to water intake, treatment and supply. IV. Remote Monitoring Operational conditions and water quality data can be accessed from any location, not just on-site. The system can be operated from remote areas, so it is ideal for areas in which access is difficult. Potential applications include large institutions that require large amounts of clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets. This water treatment system is desirable because of its low initial installation cost. More than 1,200 water treatment systems have been installed so far in Japan. Some pilot systems have been rolled out in Kenya, Africa, Vietnam, and Myanmar as well. Wellthy Corporation specializes in providing total engineering to water solutions, including many facets such as plant engineering, operation and maintenance, research and development, and water analysis.",
    "applications": "Wellthy’s water treatment system is a small-scale, on-site water treatment and supply system that utilizes existing water resource at the customer’s compound and treats the water into drinking water that meets the drinking water quality standards. The water source can be groundwater, surface water and water from public supply system. Our water treatment system combines pre-treatment process and membrane separation technology, depending on the quality of the raw water, to remove contaminants such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic.",
    "performance": "We usually design small-scale water treatment and supply systems that have a capacity from 50 to 1,000 m3/day. One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy consumption, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. Also, water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines. 3 As for the water treatment performance, our technology can improve the quality of water to meet the customer’s needs, because we design each system for every client. For example, we operate a system that produces drinking water from raw water with Color: 350 NTU, Turbidity: 62 NTU, Fe: 3.3 mg/L and Mn: 1.8 mg/L, just for your reference.",
    "risk": "Depending on the raw water quality, water treatment process could become more complex. In such case, the operating costs might increase, compared to the basic water treatment process flow, since some extra costs for chemical and waste water treatment as well as electricity would be charged additionally, as indicated below.",
    "modality_of_transaction": "Direct Investment  We are looking for direct business with the customers of our water treatment systems that produce drinking water from groundwater, surface water and city water and so on.   We can either sell the system itself or sell a service package with operation and maintenance to supply safe water continuously. We are also planning to offer a purchase scheme with less financial burden on the customer’s side. Partnership  We are looking for a local business partner or a distributor who would actively support our business of water supply services, water treatment system sales and O&M services of such systems.   When we find a potential partner(s), we will transfer the technology, necessary for the work above. Export of product  We can export our products such as water treatment system packages and related accessories, and also remote monitoring systems.",
    "technical_maturity": "As of June 2015, we have installed more than 1,000 water treatment systems in Japan and operated a few pilot systems in Kenya, Africa and in Vietnam, Southeast Asia.

Fully-automated, safe and stable water supply system Our membrane separation technology for water treatment removes contaminants, such as viruses, bacteria, anti-chlorine protozoa, iron, manganese and arsenic in raw water. Also, the system is fully automated, hence it ensures safe and stable water supply with minimum maintenance and operational effort. 2. Low initial costs and O&M costs  A “Decentralized” system like our on-site system saves initial costs and O&M costs. Compared to massive, centralized water treatment system, our water treatment systems are small-scale, designed for individual usage, installed within the client’s compound, and thus without long supply pipelines. Therefore, both the initial costs (for the system itself and construction fees) and O&M costs can be minimized. 3. Less energy consumption  One of the features of the system is that it does not require much energy, in terms of water intake, treatment and water supply. 4. Remote monitoring system  Operation data is accessible even from remote areas. Our water treatment system employs a remote monitoring system, which enables you to check the operational conditions and water quality no matter where you are. 5. Low risk for water contamination  Water contamination risk is very low, because the system does not require long distribution pipelines that are considered major source of water contamination. 6. Potential applications  With all the above characteristics, large institutions that need clean water such as hospitals, schools, and supermarkets will benefit from introduction of our system.",

    "competitive_advantage": "RPPWF™ is a class 4 solid recovered fuel, registered in the international fuel list CEN 343, and is expected to be the promising alternative resource to coal and oil. For example, RPPWF™ has a higher calorific value (over 25MJ/Kg) than coal (generally between 19-22 MJ/Kg). Compared to coal, RPPWF™ has about 20% less moisture and approximately 50% less ash. The content of Sulphur in RPPWF™ is almost negligible while coal generally contains up to about 10%. Furthermore, the CO2 emission from burning RPPWF™ is almost one third, compared to that from burning coal. Because of this ‘green’ characteristics, RPPWF™ is alternatively called Green Coal™ (this name is also a registered trademark). RPPWF™ also has higher biomass contents than conventional biomass resources. In the case of RPPWF™, more than 85% is biomass content (rests are plants or plastics).    RPPWF™ satisfies the European standard for solid recovered fuel, CEN 343, and also has certifications of ISO 14001 and ISO 9001.",
    "performance": "Because the raw materials for RPPWF™ are 100% biomass (i.e. paper, plant and wood wastes), CO2 emission of the procurement of raw materials can be mostly reduced to zero. Moreover, biomass as raw materials means less cost to procure than any other fuel resources such as coal and oil. Heat recovery rate of RPPWF™ is over 70% and the combustion efficiency is about 98% which are much higher than those of coal and oil.   The CO2 emission reduced from producing RPPWF™ can be used for CO2 credit for domestic and/or international emissions trading.   The production process of RPPWF™ is operated with heat-pump technology, a device proving heat through low carbon emission, which further improves the overall emission of the production process.",
    "risk": "Language barrier, law and regulations of candidate countries might become challenges when installing RPPWF™ production line and establishing supply chain network. Climate conditions could affect the long-term reliability of the RPPWF™ production. Good education for operators at the production site must be conducted to maintain the efficiency of RPPWF™ production.",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Amorphous Metal To produce amorphous metal, melted alloy is rapidly cooled at a speed of over 1 million °C per second. Amorphous metal is a type of metal that does not have a crystalline structure, which implies different properties in different directions. In other words, the metal has a random atomic structure which makes it extremely efficient in transformer applications. It has both high permeability and excellent soft magnetic properties. The amorphous metal used in transformers such as pole transformers and industrial transformers is mainly composed of iron. II. Energy Efficiency Energy loss of transformers largely depends on the magnetic properties of the material used for the construction of core. Metglas® reduces core loss by up to 70%. No-load loss (stand-by loss) of amorphous metal is reduced to 1/3 of those conventional materials. Amorphous metal also reduces CO2 emissions by saving energy since less energy must be generated since losses are lower in the distribution system. It is a material that saves energy and contributes to the environment. III. Cost Efficiency Most distribution transformers can be operated for 20 to 30 years. When purchasing a transformer, one must consider operating costs along with the initial price. Although initial price of amorphous metal distribution transformers (AMDT) may be higher than that of conventional distribution transformers, the long-term operating cost is lower. The total owing cost (TOC), calculated based on the initial purchase price and the cost of future energy losses, is significantly lower for AMDT. Purchase of AMDT is, therefore, an economical decision. IV. Various Use Besides transformers, Metglas® is used in inverters (solar inverter and wind inverter), hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) system, switch-mode power supply, motor control systems, and materials used in anti-theft tags, etc. Hitachi Metals, Ltd. is a leading company that produces high-quality amorphous metal that is distributed throughout the world. Metglas® is an ideal solution in power industries, allowing us to save energy, helping us reduce fossil-fuel dependency and creating a cleaner environment with higher air quality.",

When you consider that 10% of all electricity generated by utilities is lost in the transmission & distribution process, the potential savings through reductions in core loss can be significant.  Ultra-efficient transformer cores made with Metglas® amorphous metal alloy make lower core losses possible.

Standby losses are significant in electricity distribution. 2. Total Owning Cost of Distribution Transformer(DT )  DT usually can be operated 20-30 years or more (average life time in EU is around 40 years), so purchase of DT based on initial price is not economical in their lifetimes. TOC takes account of initial price and running cost in a life time, not only initial price. Price of energy efficiency product such as AMDT is usually higher than traditional products, but running cost is lower than tradition products. So, TOC is suitable economical analysis method for energy efficient products and long life products.

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Made of 100% Natural Ingredients eco-SPRAY is made of 100% natural ingredients. No hazardous or artificial chemicals are added. It is, therefore, non-toxic and does not leave any damage to cars after use. II. Easy Application eco-SPRAY is easy to apply. No preparation is required. To apply, simply remove a filter from a car engine and spray a whole bottle (30cc) through the filter. Leave it for 15 minutes until it is dry before putting it back in the car. The use of eco-SPRAY is recommended every 5,000km. III. Deep Cleaning eco-SPRAY is extremely effective in deep cleaning car engines. It removes carbon deposits from the carbon combustion chamber, cylinders, pistons, and valves. What is unique about eco-SPRAY is that it changes the fundamental chemistry of combustion. It improves how the engine uses its fuel. Eco-SPRAY breaks up the water molecules in the air entering the engine and turns them into hydrogen gas and negatively charged ions. The hydrogen gas boosts combustion while the negatively charged ions neutralize the static built up in the engine for improved fuel flow. This mechanism helps the engine to run more smoothly and to idle smoother and quieter. IV. Reduce Emissions  Incomplete combustion results in harmful gas emissions. With eco-SPRAY, harmful gas emissions are greatly reduced. A study conducted by the Japan Automobile Transport Technology Association (JATA) demonstrated that eco-SPRAY immediately reduces the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxide (NOx) by 30.4%, 23.3%, and 15.09%, respectively. V. Improve Fuel Efficiency Normally, 95% combustion is considered high. eco-SPRAY increases combustion efficiency to 95 to 100%. This contributes to better mileage, meaning less stop at the gas station is required. eco-SPRAY improves car performance by effectively cleaning the engine for better combustion efficiency. It provides more power and mileage. It also saves the environment by reducing harmful emissions.",

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Cost Efficiency  The above-mentioned clusters can be added one by one for expansion, thus cutting the cost of initial investment significantly. Also, because just the excess and shortfall of electricity is transferred, there is a 60 percent reduction in initial investment for transmission and distribution lines as compared with conventional grid.  Standardization means it can be used in many different situations and under many different conditions so as to become available over many areas.  II. Energy Efficiency  Energy efficiency is boosted by five percent thanks to the decrease in volume in energy transfer, with an increase of 15 percent with the involvement of the consumer.    lll. More Control  When the grid is paired with ECONETWORK, it can better control unpredictable residential demands as it sends the off-peak power to the ECONETWORK battery. As a result, the peak demand periods are reduced, as are the reserved capacities. In addition, when the technology uses Direct Current, efficiency improves by 10 percent or more when standby power is reduced. lV. Easy Installation  Because the system works in tandem with existing equipment, it’s easy to procure and easy to install.",
    "applications": "Power Router, PR, controls the electricity flow from one cluster (ProSumers = Producer & Consumer) to the other cluster autonomically.  PR is the key technology in ECONETWORK which is an acronym for Electricity Cluster Oriented NETWORK, ProSumers network.  PR is consisted of two inverters & battery, and accommodates the excess & shortfall transfer of electricity among clusters without expensive telecommunication lines. One inverter controls one cluster’s frequency, related to the State Of Charge, SOC, of battery, and the other controls interconnection of two clusters based on the difference of frequency. This is a very simple but very innovative method, which is covered by intellectual property right. Pro sumer E C O ECONETWORK is a new architecture for electric distribution which makes the massive deployment of Renewable Energy Sources, RES, available. RES deployed as a point, such as Solar Photovoltaic on the roof, causes the reverse tide flow to GRID, and the counter measure for it is very costly. ECONETWORK deploys RES as a group, cluster, and doesn’t cause the reverse tide flow to GRID. It can start in a small unit and expands progressively. The progressive expansion of standardized cluster using PR can achieve significant cost reduction & expandability, and thus reduce cost & complexity of electrification, especially where transmission & distribution line is not sufficient. So, we can build the low carbon society available in shorter time, by utilizing this technology. The combination of GRID/POOL with conventional synchronous generators and ECONETWORK with renewable energy sources is the solution for the low carbon society’s architecture.  Any kind of generators can be applicable to ECONETWORK",

Networking those micro-GRIDS with 50% or more of RES, we can achieve the equivalent quality to GRID, and CO2 emission reduction level, which cannot be achieved under GRID.  GRID becomes more efficient by utilizing ECONETWORK; making unpredictable residential demands to well controlled one; putting the off peak power to the battery of ECONETWORK and reducing the peak demands; reducing the reserved capacity; operating the most efficient mode, etc.  Utilizing Direct Current, 10% or more efficiency improvement can be achieved through the reduction of standby power.",

Power Router technology doesn’t require telecommunication as prerequisite, compared with another　smart GRID technology. GRID & ECONETWORK combined in urban areas gives a total optimization. By clustering consumption and reducing the energy transfer, GRID can have more capacity and lower CO2 emission.  Consumers can have their own electricity under massive black out, which is a great energy security.   Consumers can have more stable cost under ECONETWORK than under GRID, which has to be influenced by the cost of fossil fuels and so on.

PR is consisted of two inverters & battery, and accommodates the excess & shortfall transfer of electricity among clusters without expensive telecommunication lines. One inverter controls one cluster’s frequency, related to the State Of Charge, SOC, of battery, and the other controls interconnection of two clusters based on the difference of frequency. This is a very simple but very innovative method, which is covered by intellectual property right. Pro sumer E C O ECONETWORK is a new architecture for electric distribution which makes the massive deployment of Renewable Energy Sources, RES, available. RES deployed as a point, such as Solar Photovoltaic on the roof, causes the reverse tide flow to GRID, and the counter measure for it is very costly. ECONETWORK deploys RES as a group, cluster, and doesn’t cause the reverse tide flow to GRID. It can start in a small unit and expands progressively. The progressive expansion of standardized cluster using PR can achieve significant cost reduction & expandability, and thus reduce cost & complexity of electrification, especially where transmission & distribution line is not sufficient. So, we can build the low carbon society available in shorter time, by utilizing this technology. The combination of GRID/POOL with conventional synchronous generators and ECONETWORK with renewable energy sources is the solution for the low carbon society’s architecture.  Any kind of generators can be applicable to ECONETWORK Area: Low carbon & energy conservation : Energy efficiency / Renewable energy Related Links Smart Community Japan 2013 Embassy Programme: Workshop & Tour \"Key Solutions for Smart City Development\" at Smar…",

An integrated drying unit utilizes waste heat from the carbonization chamber. This results in energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant, as (with the exception of the ignition process) no fossil fuel is required.  III. Quick Process Compared with other organic waste processing methods, biomass carbonization is quicker with an output that is easier to sell. With composting, for instance, the fermentation process takes a long time, with a final output that is difficult to sell. Conversely, this carbonization plant can finish the process within one day and the output (biochar) can be sold as natural fertilizer, soil conditioner or fuel, diversifying the inventory risk.

    "competitive_advantage": "Competitive advantage compared to products of competing enterprise (1) Advantages over competitors’ carbonization plants Various processable materials Based on our experience of installing more than 70 biomass carbonization plants, Meiwa has a market-proven method of processing both wet and dry materials, while typical competitors can only deal with dry materials. Energy and cost efficient operation Meiwa can use an integrated drying unit that utilizes waste heat from carbonization chamber as well as dry biomass for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the carbonization plant. Except for the ignition process, it does not require any fossil fuel. (2) Compare to other organic waste processing method Composting is another common technology for organic waste recycling. However, it is often a problem that the fermentation process requires a long time and the final output is hard to sell for value. Compared to this, our carbonization plant can complete the process within a day and the output is easier to sell (as powerful natural fertilizer/soil conditioner or fuel).",

Easy to Use Thanks to its streamlined design and ability to be used in a variety of areas, C-POWER Plant is easy to set up, use and maintain. There is no need for professionals with special qualification. It works by thermally decomposing organic carbon such as MSW (Municipal solid waste) and biomass to generate the fuel gas, rotate the engine, and generate electricity.  C-POWER Plant is easy to set up, use and maintain. There is no need for professionals with special qualification. It works by thermally decomposing organic carbon such as MSW (M  and biomass to generate the fuel gas, rotate the engine, and generate electricity.  II. Thermal Decomposition Rather Than Incineration This technology allows waste to be thermally decomposed rather than incinerated, which results in the generation of fuel gas with a high caloric value. In the past, the only option to get rid of waste was to bury it or incinerate it. With thermochemical decomposition and gasification, this is no longer necessary. Thanks to a one of a kind rotary design, twice as much fuel gas generation can take place, when compared with standard pyrolysis technologies. This design (U-turn kiln) allows for more than 80% energy recovery ratio. IV. Used for Power Generation  IV. Used for Power Generation  Small-scale plants can use this gas for power generation. In addition, the fuel gas and hydrogen can be utilized for batteries and chemical supplies.  Small-scale plants can use this gas for power generation. In addition, the fuel gas and hydrogen can be utilized for batteries and chemical supplies.  V. No Harmful By-Products This technology does not produce harmful by-products like nitrogen oxide or dioxin. As a result, there is no treatment process needed. NEXCO East Japan is the first commercial plant in the country to use this technology. The hope for the future is that this technology can be used instead of incineration in developing countries.",

    "competitive_advantage": "<Competitor 1: other biofuel/conventional fossil fuel> Advantage 1 - cheaper substitution of fossil diesel: the rural population will save USD 0.4-0.5/litter when Jatropha fuel is used as a replacement of diesel oil (price of Jatropha fuel is about USD 1.3/litter and diesel oil in remote areas is about USD 1.7-1.8/litter). Also, while the price of fossil fuel changes depending on the market situation, Jatropha fuel can be supplied with better stability of price. Advantage 1 - cheaper substitution of fossil diesel Advantage 2 - means to produce energy with low investment/cost: since Jatropha requires least financial and labour inputs to cultivation, initial investment is smaller for investors or business owners compared to dedicated plantation models. Advantage 2 - means to produce energy with low investment/cost Advantage 3 - means to produce energy with a minimum social and environmental impact, but deliver additional income: NBF's model does not disturb livelihood or agricultural activities of participating farmers since Jatropha can be cultivated as the hedgerows of garden or field. It does not affect agricultural activities as farmers does not have to take care of Jatropha trees and harvest can be done in their spare time, but can deliver additional income to farmers. Advantage 3 - means to produce energy with a minimum social and environmental impact, but deliver additional income <Competitor 2: energy supply from solar panels and national grid> Advantage 4 - multiple usage of fuel: in rural areas, demands for the use of liquid fuel are still high for agricultural machinery such as maize mills, rice mills, water pumps etc. While solar panel or power grid can supply energy only in the form of electricity, Jatropha fuel can be used for power generation as well as agricultural machineries depending on the demand. Advantage 4 - multiple usage of fuel <Competitor 3: conventional agriculture activities> Advantage 5 - development impact: It will create an opportunity for the participating farmers to enhance their quality of life (i.e. better health condition, social service) as well as income generation opportunity. It is also NBF’s strategy to involve farmers in the value chain so they can receive benefit and become essential part of their life in order to secure the procurement of Jatropha seed. For the project plan until 2018, NBF estimates that: Advantage 5 - development impact: 27,200 farmer households and 3,600 small and medium enterprises will directly benefit a total of more than $6,000,000 by the year 2018. The business will create more than 1,000 employments in the year 2015 and 2016, and 100 employments from the year 2016 onwards. The affordable energy will enable rural residents to receive better social services (i.e. for vaccination storage with refrigerator and safer childbirth in the health centers). <Competitor 4: chemical fertiliser> Advantage 6 - Affordable and locally-available fertiliser: national average of farmer's access to fertilizers is about 3 to 6%, because of the limited access to fertiliser itself, and the high price due to import and transportation costs. Jatropha fertiliser can be supplied for one tenth of chemical fertiliser's price. The local households could save USD 1.44/ kilogram by purchasing Jatropha fertilizer. Advantage 6 - Affordable and locally-available fertiliser",
    "performance": "<Cultivation of energy crop (Jatropha)> Yield: NBF developed high yield varieties of Jatropha which can obtain yield 20 times more than the native varieties. (1,135 fruits / tree / 2year vs. native variety 44 fruits / tree / 2years) Yield Production network: 6,000 contract farmers/60 farmers’ clubs have been established. Production network <Fuel production> It is comprised of oil pressing, filtering and degumming process. It is feasible and affordable because the process is simple and low technology, and does not require special chemicals. Property of fuel: net calorific value 36.79 GJ/t (vs. diesel 43.0 GJ/t)  Oil extraction rate : 19% The produced fuel is proved to be usable as substitute of fossil diesel, such as for diesel generators and maize mills. Photo: processing of Jatropha into fuel (pressing) <Logistics> Already established a producer’s network of 6,000 farmers/100 farmers’ clubs in Cabo Delgado Province of Mozambique.  Network with maize mill owners is established. <Utilisation of Jatropha fuel> Proved to be usable as substitution fossil diesel.  Used for 20 maize mills for more than 3 months.  Used for 2 diesel generators for more than 3 months.  Hybrid system of PV panels and diesel generator by the cooperation company (Okinawa Enertech). <Utilisation of residue> According to the research by Kasetsart University, agricultural productivity, especially for tomato and sweet potato increases more than 1.5 times when biofertilizer is applied to 10 tons/ha for tomato and 2.5 tons/ha for sweet potato.

    "risk": "Security risk for raw material procurement (Jatropha seeds)  Positive commitment of farmers for cultivation activity is essential for the success of this business model. NBF is strategically establishing the network with approximately 6,000 farmers in Cabo Delgado. To strengthen the tie with the farmers, NBF keeps constant communication with the farmers’ clubs through regular visits, and also purchasing their agricultural products (i.e. rice), and even selling daily consumables to farmers in some areas. By becoming essential part of farmers’ life by bringing various benefits to them, farmers will continue to sell the seeds to NBF and are unlikely to be disturbed by other buyers who come into the area afterwards. Security risk for raw material procurement (Jatropha seeds) Risk regarding losing competitiveness due to the price drop of liquid fossil fuels and access increase to the grid electricity.  According to the world trend of fossil fuel market, the fossil fuel price is unlikely to drop in the long run unless there will be a dramatic market change or infrastructure development in the area, which is unlikely to happen given the situation. Risk regarding losing competitiveness due to the price drop of liquid fossil fuels and access increase to the grid electricity. Risk related to land pressure and water usage  There are possibilities of competition with other agricultural crops over the use of land and water resources. In the NBF’s model, Jatrpha will be planted along the border of farm land as live fences and not be planted inside the farmland, which indicates, unlike centralised plantation cultivation model, that the land pressure will not affect the cultivation of Jatropha. Moreover, Jatropha does not need a large quantity of water to grow and it survives in semi-arid areas. Thus, there are very little possibility of conflicts over water use as compared to other cash crops. Risk related to land pressure and water usage Risk associated to the climate conditions  Basically Jatrropha is a drought resistant plant. However, when the extreme whether such as severe dought or flooding the harvest of Jatropha could drop for a certain amount. Unlike other agricultural crops, Jatropha can be stablely stored in seeds or in oil, therefore, some drop of harvest can be covered with stock. Also in preparation for such event, by modifying blending ratio of Jatropha oil and other additives, production amount of end product (JAT-DIESEL) can be controlled. Risk associated to the climate conditions",

    "competitive_advantage": "RPPWF™ is a class 4 solid recovered fuel, registered in the international fuel list CEN 343, and is expected to be the promising alternative resource to coal and oil. For example, RPPWF™ has a higher calorific value (over 25MJ/Kg) than coal (generally between 19-22 MJ/Kg). Compared to coal, RPPWF™ has about 20% less moisture and approximately 50% less ash. The content of Sulphur in RPPWF™ is almost negligible while coal generally contains up to about 10%. Furthermore, the CO2 emission from burning RPPWF™ is almost one third, compared to that from burning coal. Because of this ‘green’ characteristics, RPPWF™ is alternatively called Green Coal™ (this name is also a registered trademark). RPPWF™ also has higher biomass contents than conventional biomass resources. In the case of RPPWF™, more than 85% is biomass content (rests are plants or plastics).    RPPWF™ satisfies the European standard for solid recovered fuel, CEN 343, and also has certifications of ISO 14001 and ISO 9001.",
    "performance": "Because the raw materials for RPPWF™ are 100% biomass (i.e. paper, plant and wood wastes), CO2 emission of the procurement of raw materials can be mostly reduced to zero. Moreover, biomass as raw materials means less cost to procure than any other fuel resources such as coal and oil. Heat recovery rate of RPPWF™ is over 70% and the combustion efficiency is about 98% which are much higher than those of coal and oil.   The CO2 emission reduced from producing RPPWF™ can be used for CO2 credit for domestic and/or international emissions trading.   The production process of RPPWF™ is operated with heat-pump technology, a device proving heat through low carbon emission, which further improves the overall emission of the production process.",
    "risk": "Language barrier, law and regulations of candidate countries might become challenges when installing RPPWF™ production line and establishing supply chain network.

Cost Efficiency  The above-mentioned clusters can be added one by one for expansion, thus cutting the cost of initial investment significantly. Also, because just the excess and shortfall of electricity is transferred, there is a 60 percent reduction in initial investment for transmission and distribution lines as compared with conventional grid.  Standardization means it can be used in many different situations and under many different conditions so as to become available over many areas.  II. Energy Efficiency  Energy efficiency is boosted by five percent thanks to the decrease in volume in energy transfer, with an increase of 15 percent with the involvement of the consumer.    lll. More Control  When the grid is paired with ECONETWORK, it can better control unpredictable residential demands as it sends the off-peak power to the ECONETWORK battery. As a result, the peak demand periods are reduced, as are the reserved capacities. In addition, when the technology uses Direct Current, efficiency improves by 10 percent or more when standby power is reduced. lV.

The system has passed both durability and efficiency tests conducted by third parties indicating that performance is promising. The company assures 20-year performance of the entire system with degradation level of 20% or less. II. No Batteries Required The key part of this technology is the system controller which controls the output of the solar module. When diesel generators are combined with the solar module, the output of the solar module is controlled low enough to keep the diesel generators operating at their minimum operation level. This avoids inefficient diesel generator operation and enables the system to operate efficiently without batteries. With conventional hybrid systems, the capacity of the PV module has to be limited to around 10% of the diesel generator capacity. However with KYOCERA Corporation’s system, solar modules with a capacity of up to 50-60% of the diesel generators can be installed (e.g. DG 500kW : PV 250-300kW).    KYOCERA Corporation has 25 years of experience in photovoltaic operation and has been distributing their systems with different capacities worldwide.

    "description": "Our proposed product, Solar Street Light, is a self-sustained street light where electricity is generated by attached efficient solar panel. Solar Street Light can be installed in streets and traffic roads, and at parks and other facilities where light is required for improved security and quality of life. Also, multiple installation may enhance the lighting environment for better quality of life. By utilizing the strengths of GS Yuasa's battery technology, the costs for installation, operation and maintenance are significantly reduced because of its very unique construction, it means very easy maintenance (replacement of the battery). We believe that our proposed product is commercially suitable in developing countries where demand for street light from solar power is high and electricity infrastructure is not improved enough for installing conventional street lights.

    "features_and_advantages": "Major Features and Advantages I. Easy Transportation & Installation  Major wind turbine companies today are mainly manufacturing larger systems (i.e. 2,000kW and 3,000kW) and not mid-sized systems (100kW to 600kW). The KWT300 is a rare mid-sized system, which generates 300kW. Transportation and installation of the KWT300 are easy. The entire system can be transported by a 10-ton truck, and the system can be installed in a narrow space, using a small 60-ton crane. Large trailers are not needed. The compact size allows the system to be built on premises of existing facilities. The system is especially useful in remote areas with limited access to fuel, and it will secure power supply while reducing the use of other types of energy such as diesel. II. High Resistance to Wind, Lightning & Earthquakes The KWT300 is highly resistant to wind. The maximum wind speed that the system resists is 70m/s, which is higher than the speed most other European models can resist. The turbulence parameter of the KWT300 is greater than the highest level of the International Electric Committee (IEC) standard. The system is also protected from lightning. The KWT300 meets the requirement of both Japanese and world standards for lightning protection. Besides, the risk of damage from an earthquake is minimal. The system offers two different levels of earthquake protection depending on the characteristics of the region and ground conditions. The system was originally designed to be used in Japan, but has also been installed and used in other places including Mexico, Bhutan and Kamchatka. KOMAIHALTEC Inc. hopes to promote this technology worldwide to ensure a stable, long-term supply of electricity to help local communities.",
    "competitive_advantage": "Our product is one of very few high-spec mid-size wind turbines available in the world. Major wind turbine manufacturers now concentrate on much larger systems (i.e. 2000kW and 3000kW wind turbines) and no longer provide mid-size wind turbines (100kW to 600kW). While most of the mid-size wind turbines are manufactured with the license of old European models, our wind turbine KWT300 are newly designed and equipped with all up-to-date wind turbine design. KWT300 is highly adaptable to the conditions of developing countries because of the following features: 1. Flexibility Easy transportation –All parts are transportable with 10 ton trucks (parts are compactly designed). They can be delivered to the site with poor road access. Easy construction –KWT300 can be installed with as small as 60 ton crane, which could enable the installation in narrow space and reduce the construction cost. Various applications –Because of its unique size, KWT300 can be used for a mid-size wind park, electric supply for existing facilities and community electricity. 2. Safety Design Strong under extreme wind –The survival wind speed is 70m/s, which is higher than many other European models. Stable under unstable wind –KWT300 has set the turbulence parameter larger than the International Electric Committee (IEC) standard. Best lightening protection system –The best lightening protection system, defined by IEC. High earthquake resistance –KWT300 has two models; 300gal and 1000gal.",

It works by thermally decomposing organic carbon such as MSW (M  and biomass to generate the fuel gas, rotate the engine, and generate electricity.  II. Thermal Decomposition Rather Than Incineration This technology allows waste to be thermally decomposed rather than incinerated, which results in the generation of fuel gas with a high caloric value. In the past, the only option to get rid of waste was to bury it or incinerate it. With thermochemical decomposition and gasification, this is no longer necessary. Thanks to a one of a kind rotary design, twice as much fuel gas generation can take place, when compared with standard pyrolysis technologies. This design (U-turn kiln) allows for more than 80% energy recovery ratio. IV. Used for Power Generation  IV. Used for Power Generation  Small-scale plants can use this gas for power generation. In addition, the fuel gas and hydrogen can be utilized for batteries and chemical supplies.  Small-scale plants can use this gas for power generation. In addition, the fuel gas and hydrogen can be utilized for batteries and chemical supplies.  V. No Harmful By-Products This technology does not produce harmful by-products like nitrogen oxide or dioxin. As a result, there is no treatment process needed. NEXCO East Japan is the first commercial plant in the country to use this technology. The hope for the future is that this technology can be used instead of incineration in developing countries.",
