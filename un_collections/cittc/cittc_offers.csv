The invention relates to a device for filtering air comprising a filter housing having an air inlet for directing flow of air drawn into the housing from atmosphere and an air outlet for directing flow of air exhausted from the housing to atmosphere, the air drawn into the housing carrying air contaminants therewith. A plurality of cylindrical filter stacks having substantially parallel longitudinal axes are disposed in the housing. The filter stacks have outer cylindrical filter walls and inner passages extending therethrough along the longitudinal axes. The filter stacks are capable of filtering the air drawn into the housing by trapping the air contaminants in the filter walls when air is drawn through the filter walls into the inner passages. Finally, a blower is disposed within the filter housing for (1) drawing the air from atmosphere into the filter housing through the air inlet, (2) drawing the air through the filter walls into the inner passages to trap the air contaminants in the filter walls to thereby produce filtered air within the inner passages, and (3) exhausting the filtered air through the air outlet into the atmosphere.
* Technical Details
HEPA filters offer an advantage over other type of filter media in that the amount of airborne pollutants which can be effectively removed from the air is significantly increased. HEPA filters have been defined as filters capable of removing 99.97 percent of airborne particles of the size of 0.3 microns or larger. The filters are designed to maintain higher flow rates (between approximately 150 to 700 cubic feet per minute) than comparable filters, and it has been found that HEPA filters last for longer periods of time and, therefore, offer cost savings to the consumer. There is a particular need for HEPA filtration of airborne particulates in health-care facilities. Specifically, the risk of acquiring tuberculosis in a health-care environment is a function of a concentration of infectious droplet nuclei. This invention offers improved airflow which to circulate all the air within a room through the filter media as often as possible to insure continuous removal of infectious droplet nuclei.",2015.02.12,,Other,Not Available,0086 10 8348 7835,Health Care,HEPA Filtration System,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

* Technical Details
Background
Carbapenem antibiotics are highly potent, broad spectrum compounds that are resistant to most Beta-lactamases. Their sales represent an estimated $15 billion in the US, and as a family they constitute more than 65% of the global antibiotic market. Commercially useful carbapenem Beta-lactam antibiotics are currently produced by a fully synthetic method which is complex and expensive.

JHU scientists have isolated, synthesized, and characterized enzymes that catalyze critical steps (introduction of the (8R)-hydroxyl group) in the synthesis of carbapenem Beta-lactam antibiotics. These enzymes are highly efficient, and provide for the development of simpler, cheaper, and more robust routes of syntheses for this class of compounds.
The invention enables introduction of the (8R)-hydroxyl group late in a chemo enzymatic production process of clinically-used carbapenem Beta-lactams antibiotics.

Tool tracking/guidance is pivotal to determining operation success and guaranteeing clinical outcome. The proposed invention consists of modified tools that can be incorporated into most commercial ultrasonic imaging systems. Expensive ultrasound systems do not need to be replaced. A one-time addition of external electronics to the system coupled with tools containing the proposed enhancements is all that will be needed to make use of the proposed invention. The proposed invention solves this problem by creating an “active reflection” imaging system in which modified interventional tools are used.
Technical Details
Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an imaging system in which modified interventional tools are used. The tools are modified so that the relevant portions of the tools contain a device that can detect the ultrasonic field and emit an ultrasonic pulse. Detection of the ultrasonic field is relayed to external electronics, which interpret the field signal and transmit a signal back to the probe, telling it to emit one or more ultrasonic pulses. When integrated with a commercial ultrasound system, this strength may be used to determine probe location in when viewed in the ultrasonic system. Multiple pulse emitters on the modified tools can be used to determine orientation of the device with most conventional ultrasound systems.",2015.02.12,,Imaging,Under Development,0086 10 8348 7835,Health Care,Closed-Loop Ultrasound Imaging System,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

Surgical robots are increasingly used to aid surgical procedures, as these technologies offer improved control and better visibility of surgical sites when compared to alternative minimally invasive surgical techniques. Many surgical robots have quick-release tool holders, which allows for easy exchange of different tools and fast removal of a tool in case of emergency. Needle-shaped tools are most commonly used with these quick-release tool holders; however, many surgical tools, specifically those used for head and neck surgery, have needles that are too wide or too long to be held by existing tool holders, and it is impractical to have multiple tool holders of different sizes on a single robot. Additionally, tool holders do not allow for rotation of a surgical device about its axis, limiting the surgeons control and range of motion with needle-shaped surgical tools. This invention is a novel tool holder without tool size limitations that allows for full control of axial rotation of surgical tools, in addition to existing motion control. Additional advantages over current tool holders include:• Automatic tool detachment from tool holder with high exerted force: Protects the robot, tool, and patient from excessive force
• Quick and easy tool attachment/detachment: Handheld cylindrical surgical tools of any size held by magnetic force to the side of the tool holder
• Adjustable parameters for automatic tool detachment: Holding force can be adjusted by adjusting the distance from the magnets to the rotor
Technical Details
Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a tool holder system to provide quick tool connection-disconnection functionalities and to offer control over axial rotation of surgical tools. The tool holder is comprised of two main parts, a rotor which is fixed to the tool shaft, and a stator which is fixed to the robot. The rotor rotation of the surgical tool can be controlled by a motor system. Though designed for use in surgical robotic tool holders, this invention could potentially be refined for and used in industrial and manufacturing applications.",2015.02.12,,Medical Devices,Under Development,0086 10 8348 7835,Health Care,Rotation-Preserving Quick-Connect System between Surgical Robot and Tools,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

Magnetometers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes are used together in a number of applications, including vehicle navigation systems and personal electronics devices, such as smart phones and tablet devices. The combination of these sensors allows for the estimation of the full attitude (heading, pitch, and roll) of a device; however, all of these sensors are affected by biases, scale factors, and non-orthogonality. Existing methods of device calibration require 360 degree movement of the device in one or several degrees of freedom in order to estimate accelerometer and magnetometer bias from gyroscope data and defined start and end positions; these methods are computation-intensive and require users to manually change device attitude to calculate bias and recalibrate. This method allows for the convenient and accurate estimation of the bias of magnetometers and accelerometers, eliminating the need for user intervention. Additional advantages of this method include:• Does not require numerical integration of gyroscope data or defined start and end positions
• Can be calculated continuously
• Requires less processing time and can be easily implemented
Technical Details
Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel methodology for correcting magnetometer and accelerometer bias. This method solves for unknown sensor bias within the inertial reference frame using the sensor measurement and the inertial reference measurement within the same inertial reference frame. The proposed solution relates the sensor measurement rate with the angular rate measured by the gyroscope. This solution can be implemented using least squares estimation, adaptive identification or Kalman filter. Notably, this method does not require numerical differentiation of sensor measurements, allowing for accurate, real-time estimation of sensor bias.",2015.01.29,,Other,Under Development,0086 10 8348 7835,Automotive,Method for Magnetometer and Accelerometer Calibration,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

Yet, the heavy weight and high installation costs of conventional green roofs remain challenges, and there is great interest in improved affordable systems. An easy to install, lightweight small footprint green roof optimized for climbing plants, providing equivalent service for greatly diminished weight and costs has been developed in response to the green roof challenges. Advantages include:• Lightweight green roof technology supportable on any type of roof
• Permits easy, low-cost installation and maintenance

Technical Details
Johns Hopkins researchers have designed a lightweight green roof technology suitable for a cost-efficient installation on any type of roof. Conventional green roofs consist of an artificial planting bed laid over a conventional roofing surface, often including additional layers to protect the underlying roof. Thus, due to their heavy weight current green roofs are only supportable by flat roofs and require costly professional installation. This technology describes a novel small footprint green roof system comprised of a series of elevated planters equipped with a water reservoir that are connected to one another by wires colonized by climbing plants. Only a fraction of the roof surface needs to support growing apparatuses permitting installation on different roof configurations as well as reducing cost for material, installation, and maintenance.

These assemblies can form from any protein and nanoparticle combination given the right conditions. Supraparticles were shown to maintain the stability of the proteins by keeping them in a folded state in the confines of the new hybrid structure. Thus, supraparticles present a viable option for enzyme stabilization. Such systems also lend themselves to the integration of the optical and electric properties of metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles with the biological function of enzymes.

* CFRP composites have become widely used in many industries as a structural building material due to their mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties.  In particular CFRP composites have a high Young’s modulus, excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, high tensile strength, and they show excellent material properties in toughness and fatigue.
* CRFP composites, while extremely useful are subject to catastrophic fatigue failure.  This invention discloses a new device that measures CRFP composite strain and helps determine when any fatigue failure is likely to occur.  As strain is measured, catastrophic fatigue failure can be predicted and avoided.  More particularly, piezoresistive (NiNs) composite strain gauges are embedded between layers of CRFP  to measure the strain in a given sample.  As the composite sample strains, the resistivity of the NiNs measurably changes, which change can be correlated to the amount of strain present in the composite sample.  NiNs strain gauges allow real time, in-situ strain monitoring of carbon fiber composites.
* Tests indicate that the high electrical conductivity of the NiNs allow it to measure even small strains placed on a particular composite sample.  Additionally, there is no material time lag between the actual strain and the measurement as taken by the NiNs strain gauge further increasing its effectiveness in predicting fatigue failure.  Moreover, the introduction of NiNs strain gauges into a composite sample does not materially affect the mechanical properties of the CFRP sample.
* While the ability to monitor fatigue in composite structures is vital to the growing industry, the current methods are less than adequate.  A few valuable strain sensing methods include: traditional strain gauges, Raman wavenumber sensing, piezoresistive self-sensing, acoustic emissions sensing, and fiber Bragg grating.  These methods are useful in limited situations, however, they typically are not accurate enough, too expensive, or too difficult for practical application in CFRP composite strain measurement.
* NiNs strain gauges, by comparison, are relatively inexpensive and can be simply incorporated into almost any application to elicit an accurate measurement of strain in a given CFRP composite.  The demand for carbon fiber could then become more stable and expand into new applications resulting in lowered cost of carbon fiber and the potential to utilize these promising materials in a wider range of products.",2015.01.21,,None,Bench Scale,0086 10 8348 7835,,Nickel Nanocomposite Strain Gauge,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

* Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a tear in the inner lining of an aortic artery is formed. This can further lead to the formation of a blood clot that obstructs blood flow and can ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke with an 80% mortality rate at two weeks, if left untreated. While certain less severe cases might be treated with blood pressure lowering drugs, such as beta blockers or sodium nitroprusside, the current standard of treatment for the majority of the estimated 10,000 annual cases in the U.S. is to apply open surgery.
* Rather than applying open surgery, which adds inherent risk for the patient, the Aquablade solves this problem in a much less invasive manner through the use of a catheter-based surgical device for cutting the displaced tissue. This also provides for a speedier recovery for the patient due to the non-invasive manner of this approach. Besides cutting displaced tissue, most often the inner wall of the aorta, this device can also be used to safely cut previously deployed stents, thereby allowing for their removal. This would be especially useful in cases where a patient has outgrown a stent or a stent has been improperly sized and/or placed. In a third embodiment, this device can be used to deploy stents and cut them to an appropriate length within the blood vessel, thereby ensuring the correct stent length for covering the entire diseased area without over- or under-sizing.",2015.01.21,,Medical Devices,Bench Scale,0086 10 8348 7835,Health Care,Surgical Jet for Aortic Dissection,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

* Increased DNA damage response and DNA repair activity in cancer cells contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Overcoming chemotherapeutic resistance is a major problem in dire need of a solution. Researchers at UNMC decided to attack this problem by seeking inhibitors that target a small protein which plays a critical role in repairing damaged DNA by associating with single-stranded DNA along with coordinating the assembly and action of protein complexes important for its repair. Initial screening efforts have identified a number of hits as potential RPA1 inhibitors. One of the more promising hits, Compound #2, has been analyzed in a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays.
* In particular, Compound #2 was found to inhibit the essential protein-interacting domain of RPA1 at nanomolar ranges. More importantly, this compound was also found to be cell permeable. As shown below via an MTT assay, which measures cell proliferation and viability, this compound dramatically reduces cell survival in comparison to a related composition, Compound #1, and a Control treatment.
* UNMC researchers are now actively conducting a hit-to-lead optimization to further develop these compounds into useable drugs for use alone or in combination with other therapeutics for a more effective treatment of cancer, including those that are found to be drug-resistant.

Evaporator with improved cooling performance
This design uses a refrigerant evaporator for a motor vehicle air conditioning and ventilating system with an air inlet face that receives a non-uniform airflow pattern from a radial air blower. The evaporator uses refrigerant passes with flow areas and volumes selected to contract the refrigerant flow at the outlet of the evaporator. This will produce more refrigerant cooling in the portion of the evaporator core that receives higher airflow. This creates uniform outlet air temperature distribution from the evaporator into the vehicle interior. This technology is an efficient, cost-effective method to improve cooling performance.

Highly water-repellant materials (also known as “Superhydrophobic Surfaces”) have been created and employed in a number of applications. However, their widespread use to date has been hampered by the fact that such materials are generally non-transparent. As such, these materials have not been suitable for windows, windshields, camera lenses, and other optical devices. The material developed at the Wayne State University College of Engineering has the unique property of being completely transparent, and as such could be used in applications which to date have not been served by opaque superhydrophobic materials. The invention is a new material structure capable of repelling water and self-cleaning as well as its fabrication methods. Liquid repellency of solid surfaces is critical for many applications, including the prevention of the adhesion of moist and ice to windows, self-cleaning traffic indicators, stopping clotting in artificial blood vessels, and stain-resistant textiles. The hydrophobicity of a surface can be enhanced by a chemical modification that lowers the surface energy. A superhydrophobic surface results from the increase of the surface roughness. This effect can be observed in nature on the leaves of the sacred lotus. The surfaces of these leaves have micrometer-scale roughness (10-100 ìm), resulting in water contact angles up to 170°, because air that is trapped between the droplets and the wax crystals at the plant surface minimizes the contact area. Superhydrophobic surfaces that have water contact angles larger than 150° have been obtained by controlling the surface topography of expensive hydrophobic materials using various processing methods, such as machining and etching. Since all these surfaces have micrometer-scale roughness, they are not optically transparent due to diffraction scattering.",2014.12.25,,Nano Materials,Not Available,+86 10 82696139-812,New Materials,Self-Cleaning Transparent Material Structure,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

• Addresses a major need in new methods for efficient biofuel production
• Fundamentally different from conventional supercritical CO2 extraction
• Does not use toxic chemicals or expensive mechanical equipment
• Substantial algal biofuel cost reduction* Technical Details
The algal biofuels industry represents an exciting opportunity to take advantage of the ability of microalgae to convert carbon dioxide and sunlight to liquid fuels. Algae offer the ability to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) generated by coal fired power plants, ethanol plants, petroleum refineries, and a number of other man-made and natural processes. New and effective methods for extracting oils from microalgae are an important area of research and development to make algae as economically viable feedstock for lipid production. In particular, current technologies used for oil extraction require toxic organic solvents as well as expensive centrifuge steps representing nearly half of the total capital costs excluding systems to separate the lipid fraction from water and algal biomass. As such, the costs of the lipid purification currently represent the single most significant cost and technological barrier to algal biofuels commercialization. This technology provides a novel application of readily available CO2 as a solute to overcome these cost and obstacles to lipid purification.",2014.12.05,US,Waste to Energy,Bench Scale,+862865056429,Life Sciences and New Energy,An Economically and Environmentally-sound Process for Enhanced Extraction and Purification of Oils from Wet Microalgal Biomass Using High Pressure CO2 as a Solute,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

2 Years,Caopanpan,Finland,cpp@chinatis.com,CITTC,,,Not Provided,,,Other Mode,Caopanpan,VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland,Overseas Company/Agency,"VTT has developed a new concept for cleaning indoor air from fine particles. The concept is based on the cleaning of the secondary air flow induced by the supply air flow (Patent pending). In principle, the concept can be utilized in any supply air device or diffuser, but VTT has identified active chilled beams as the most promising application.
Air conditioning systems based on the use of chilled beams have many advantages such as energy and space efficiency, and high cooling capacity. By integrating air cleaning into the chilled beams, the particle concentration in indoor air can be reduced by approximately 70%. Energy consumption of the new air cleaning solution is negligible.
The new air cleaning concept can be used in almost any kind of building (e.g. hotels, offices etc.). A significant advantage of this technique is that the indoor air quality can be improved in existing buildings without major changes in the ventilation system and without increasing air flow rates. Besides the air conditioning systems of buildings, the new concept can also be used to improve air quality in cruisers, trains and buses.",2014.11.01,,Energy Efficiency Building,Not Available,+86 10 82696139-812,Building Construction,New concept for improving,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59

Chempolis’state-of-the-art formico processes have been developed for biorefining non-wood and non-food materials, such as straw, grasses, bagasse, and many other residues. By using a new type of biosolvent, they overcome the challenges typically faced by other technologies. - for producing high-quality fibre for paper and board, packaging, and hygiene products. The formicofib? process has been specially developed for non-wood raw materials and offers a more favourable chemistry than current technologies, requires fewer operations, and consumes less chemicals. As it does not require forest inputs, does not generate net CO2 emissions, is effluent-free, and consumes minimal amounts of water, formicofib? represents the most sustainable pulping technology available today.–for producing bioethanol for biofuels. Just like formicofib?, formicobio? also avoids the main problems associated with other technologies developed for non-food raw materials–and represents a true third-generation technology for producing liquid biofuels. Both formicofib? and formicobio? enable the coproduction of biochemicals, such as acetic acid and furfural, which are used as a raw material in the production of paints, adhesives, and plastics, and as a solvent and raw material for resins.",2014.11.01,,Bio-agriculture,Not Available,+86 10 82696139-812,Agriculture,Biorefining,,CITTC,offer,11/09/2017 19:01:59
