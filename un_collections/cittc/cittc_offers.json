for directing flow of air drawn into the housing from atmosphere and an air outlet for directing flow of air exhausted from the housing to atmosphere, the air drawn into the housing carrying air contaminants therewith. A plurality of cylindrical filter stacks having substantially parallel longitudinal axes are disposed in the housing. The filter stacks have outer cylindrical filter walls and inner passages extending therethrough along the longitudinal axes. The filter stacks are capable of filtering the air drawn into the housing by trapping the air contaminants in the filter walls when air is drawn through the filter walls into the inner passages. Finally, a blower is disposed within the filter housing for (1) drawing the air from atmosphere into the filter housing through the air inlet, (2) drawing the air through the filter walls into the inner passages to trap the air contaminants in the filter walls to thereby produce filtered air within the inner passages, and (3) exhausting the filtered air through the air outlet into the atmosphere.\n* Technical Details\nHEPA filters offer an advantage over other type of filter media in that the amount of airborne pollutants which can be effectively removed from the air is significantly increased. HEPA filters have been defined as filters capable of removing 99.97 percent of airborne particles of the size of 0.3 microns or larger. The filters are designed to maintain higher flow rates (between approximately 150 to 700 cubic feet per minute) than comparable filters, and it has been found that HEPA filters last for longer periods of time and, therefore, offer cost savings to the consumer. There is a particular need for HEPA filtration of airborne particulates in health-care facilities. Specifically, the risk of acquiring tuberculosis in a health-care environment is a function of a concentration of infectious droplet nuclei. This invention offers improved airflow which to circulate all the air within a room through the filter media as often as possible to insure continuous removal of infectious droplet nuclei.","published":"2015.02.12","region":null,"secondary_field":"Other","technology_readiness_level":"Not Available","contact_phone":"0086 10 8348 7835","sector":"Health Care","title":"HEPA Filtration System","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"3 Months","By":"Joe Kao","country":"United States","contact_email":"xma@chinatis.com","contact_employer":"CITTC ISO","patent_info":null,"implementation":null,"intellectual_property_type":"Not Provided","keywords":"motor, armature, current, feedback, velocity","market_prospect":"Medical Industry","cooperation_type":"Commercializaiton","contact_person":"Joe Kao","contact_organization":"Johns Hopkins University Office of Technology Transfer","contact_organization_type":"Colleges & Universities","description":"* Technical Details\nAn integrated chip for control of position\/velocity and torque of DC motor is provided.

Many surgical robots have quick-release tool holders, which allows for easy exchange of different tools and fast removal of a tool in case of emergency. Needle-shaped tools are most commonly used with these quick-release tool holders; however, many surgical tools, specifically those used for head and neck surgery, have needles that are too wide or too long to be held by existing tool holders, and it is impractical to have multiple tool holders of different sizes on a single robot. Additionally, tool holders do not allow for rotation of a surgical device about its axis, limiting the surgeons control and range of motion with needle-shaped surgical tools. This invention is a novel tool holder without tool size limitations that allows for full control of axial rotation of surgical tools, in addition to existing motion control.

Such systems also lend themselves to the integration of the optical and electric properties of metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles with the biological function of enzymes.\n* Supraparticles that combined cadmium telluride nanoparticles with Cytochrome C protein, as well as a redox enzyme and a sacrificial electron donor, were not only stable but showed impressive photoenzymatic activity when irradiated with light. In the future, these kinds of materials could be used for solar fuel production.","published":"2015.01.29","region":null,"secondary_field":"Therapeutics","technology_readiness_level":"Bench Scale","contact_phone":"0086 10 8348 7835","sector":"Health Care","title":"Bio-Nano Supraparticles for Enzyme Stabilization","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"3 Months","By":"Joe Kao","country":"United States","contact_email":"xma@chinatis.com","contact_employer":"CITTC ISO","patent_info":null,"implementation":null,"intellectual_property_type":"Not Provided","keywords":"cancer, drug, medicine, treatment, novel","market_prospect":"Medical Industry","cooperation_type":"Licensing Opportunities","contact_person":"Joe Kao","contact_organization":"University of Michigan Techtransfer","contact_organization_type":"Colleges & Universities","description":"* Problem this technology could solve: Currently all patients with similar type of cancer receive similar treatment, even though the development of a tumor and further progression of the disease is often different in each individual. This traditional approach to cancer treatment has always entailed accepting the risks of individualized adverse reactions, including death, in some cases and inefficiencies that inflate health care costs and undermine patient care.\n* This technologyprovides a novel approach that integrates personalized medicine with targeted drug delivery for cancer management. The invention uses synthetic High Density Lipoprotein (sHDL) nanoparticles for targeted delivery of cancer drugs with a personalized medicine approach. The researchers propose to selectively deliver cancer drug containing sHDL nanoparticles to tumors through a receptor that is differentially expressed in tumors. The inventors have demonstrated the proof-of-concept and feasibility of customized, targeted drug delivery to tumors both in vitro and in vivo using this approach. They have also established that drug loaded sHDL has similar or better cytotoxicity in vitro relative to free drug.","published":"2015.01.29","region":null,"secondary_field":"Therapeutics","technology_readiness_level":"Bench Scale","contact_phone":"0086 10 8348 7835","sector":"Health Care","title":"High Density Lipoprotein Nanoparticles for Targeted Delivery of Cancer Drugs in Personalized Medicine","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"3 Months","By":"Joe Kao","country":"United States","contact_email":"xma@chinatis.com","contact_employer":"CITTC ISO","patent_info":null,"implementation":null,"intellectual_property_type":"Not Provided","keywords":"biofilm, bacterial, plumbing, food, antibiotic","market_prospect":"Food Industry","cooperation_type":"Licensing Opportunities","contact_person":"Joe Kao","contact_organization":"University of Michigan Techtransfer","contact_organization_type":"Colleges & Universities","description":"* Bacterial biofilms are aggregates of bacterial cells that can form on living and non-living surfaces in a variety of situations including natural water bodies and surfaces, plumbing, food-related counters and surfaces, and implanted devices such as heart valves and catheters.

Previous methods for pretreatment of ligno-cellulose to enhance conversion to fuels involve reaction with strong acids and bases and technologies that utilize genetically engineered enzymes and bacteria.\nHowever, these technologies have not proven to be commercially viable because of cost of the pretreatment. The current invention utilizes a readily available and inexpensive chemical to overcome the limitations and costs of previous pretreatment methods.\u00a0 This pretreatment converts ligno-cellulose into a biologically degradable substrate suitable for feeding to the consortium of bacteria in an anaerobic digester. The product of this process is natural gas (methane) and compost.\n* The new pretreatment can be used to treat both cellulose and lignin so they can be converted to methane.

properties of Nickel nanostrand\u00a0 (NiNs) nanocomposites.\u00a0 These NiNs nanocomposites are formed into strain gauges and are embedded into a sample carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CRFP) composite wherein they measure the strain.\n* CFRP composites have become widely used in many industries as a structural building material due to their mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties.\u00a0 In particular CFRP composites have a high Young\u2019s modulus, excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, high tensile strength, and they show excellent material properties in toughness and fatigue.\n* CRFP composites, while extremely useful are subject to catastrophic fatigue failure.\u00a0 This invention discloses a new device that measures CRFP composite strain and helps determine when any fatigue failure is likely to occur.\u00a0 As strain is measured, catastrophic fatigue failure can be predicted and avoided.\u00a0 More particularly, piezoresistive (NiNs) composite strain gauges are embedded between layers of CRFP\u00a0 to measure the strain in a given sample.\u00a0 As the composite sample strains, the resistivity of the NiNs measurably changes, which change can be correlated to the amount of strain present in the composite sample.\u00a0 NiNs strain gauges allow real time, in-situ strain monitoring of carbon fiber composites.\n* Tests indicate that the high electrical conductivity of the NiNs allow it to measure even small strains placed on a particular composite sample.\u00a0 Additionally, there is no material time lag between the actual strain and the measurement as taken by the NiNs strain gauge further increasing its effectiveness in predicting fatigue failure.\u00a0 Moreover, the introduction of NiNs strain gauges into a composite sample does not materially affect the mechanical properties of the CFRP sample.\n* While the ability to monitor fatigue in composite structures is vital to the growing industry, the current methods are less than adequate.\u00a0 A few valuable strain sensing methods include: traditional strain gauges, Raman wavenumber sensing, piezoresistive self-sensing, acoustic emissions sensing, and fiber Bragg grating.\u00a0 These methods are useful in limited situations, however, they typically are not accurate enough, too expensive, or too difficult for practical application in CFRP composite strain measurement.\n* NiNs strain gauges, by comparison, are relatively inexpensive and can be simply incorporated into almost any application to elicit an accurate measurement of strain in a given CFRP composite.\u00a0 The demand for carbon fiber could then become more stable and expand into new applications resulting in lowered cost of carbon fiber and the potential to utilize these promising materials in a wider range of products.","published":"2015.01.21","region":null,"secondary_field":"None","technology_readiness_level":"Bench Scale","contact_phone":"0086 10 8348

This can further lead to the formation of a blood clot that obstructs blood flow and can ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke with an 80% mortality rate at two weeks, if left untreated. While certain less severe cases might be treated with blood pressure lowering drugs, such as beta blockers or sodium nitroprusside, the current standard of treatment for the majority of the estimated 10,000 annual cases in the U.S. is to apply open surgery.\n* Rather than applying open surgery, which adds inherent risk for the patient, the Aquablade solves this problem in a much less invasive manner through the use of a catheter-based surgical device for cutting the displaced tissue. This also provides for a speedier recovery for the patient due to the non-invasive manner of this approach. Besides cutting displaced tissue, most often the inner wall of the aorta, this device can also be used to safely cut previously deployed stents, thereby allowing for their removal. This would be especially useful in cases where a patient has outgrown a stent or a stent has been improperly sized and\/or placed.

Highly water-repellant materials (also known as \u201cSuperhydrophobic Surfaces\u201d) have been created and employed in a number of applications. However, their widespread use to date has been hampered by the fact that such materials are generally non-transparent. As such, these materials have not been suitable for windows, windshields, camera lenses, and other optical devices. The material developed at the Wayne State University College of Engineering has the unique property of being completely transparent, and as such could be used in applications which to date have not been served by opaque superhydrophobic materials. The invention is a new material structure capable of repelling water and self-cleaning as well as its fabrication methods. Liquid repellency of solid surfaces is critical for many applications, including the prevention of the adhesion of moist and ice to windows, self-cleaning traffic indicators, stopping clotting in artificial blood vessels, and stain-resistant textiles. The hydrophobicity of a surface can be enhanced by a chemical modification that lowers the surface energy. A superhydrophobic surface results from the increase of the surface roughness. This effect can be observed in nature on the leaves of the sacred lotus. The surfaces of these leaves have micrometer-scale roughness (10-100 \u00ecm), resulting in water contact angles up to 170\u00b0, because air that is trapped between the droplets and the wax crystals at the plant surface minimizes the contact area. Superhydrophobic surfaces that have water contact angles larger than 150\u00b0 have been obtained by controlling the surface topography of expensive hydrophobic materials using various processing methods, such as machining and etching. Since all these surfaces have micrometer-scale roughness, they are not optically transparent due to diffraction scattering.","published":"2014.12.25","region":null,"secondary_field":"Nano Materials","technology_readiness_level":"Not Available","contact_phone":"+86 10 82696139-812","sector":"New Materials","title":"Self-Cleaning Transparent Material Structure","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"2 Years","By":"Caopanpan","country":"United States","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com ","contact_employer":"CITTC ","patent_info":"US6782109 B2","implementation":null,"intellectual_property_type":"Not Provided","keywords":"self-powered, wireless, electromechanical acoustic liner, noise reduction","market_prospect":null,"cooperation_type":"Comercialization","contact_person":"Caopanpan","contact_organization":"Office of Technology Licensing","contact_organization_type":null,"description":"University of Florida researchers have developed a self-powered, wireless device that can effectively reduce noise for situations in which the noise is unknown or variable, such as when an aircraft throttles up its engines or pulls back for landing.

Algae offer the ability to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) generated by coal fired power plants, ethanol plants, petroleum refineries, and a number of other man-made and natural processes. New and effective methods for extracting oils from microalgae are an important area of research and development to make algae as economically viable feedstock for lipid production. In particular, current technologies used for oil extraction require toxic organic solvents as well as expensive centrifuge steps representing nearly half of the total capital costs excluding systems to separate the lipid fraction from water and algal biomass. As such, the costs of the lipid purification currently represent the single most significant cost and technological barrier to algal biofuels commercialization. This technology provides a novel application of readily available CO2 as a solute to overcome these cost and obstacles to lipid purification.","published":"2014.12.05","region":"US","secondary_field":"Waste to Energy","technology_readiness_level":"Bench Scale","contact_phone":"+862865056429","sector":"Life Sciences and New Energy","title":"An Economically and Environmentally-sound Process for Enhanced Extraction and Purification of Oils from Wet Microalgal Biomass Using High Pressure CO2 as a Solute","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"6 Months","By":"Wojciech Karmasz","country":"Germany","contact_email":"xma@chinatis.com","contact_employer":"CITTC ISO","patent_info":"* PCT\/EP2009\/000477 * CN 200980112506.9 * EP 09 704 030.7 * JP 2010-543441 * US 12\/864,197","implementation":"Drugs Production, Medical Care","intellectual_property_type":"Copyright","keywords":"hepatitis b, liver, peptides","market_prospect":null,"cooperation_type":"Joint Development,Joint Venture,Purchase of Project","contact_person":"Wojciech Karmasz","contact_organization":"Technology Transfer Heidelberg GmbH","contact_organization_type":null,"description":"* This invention relates to hydrophobic modified preS-derived peptides of hepatitis B virus (HBV) which can be versatile vehicles for the specific delivery of compounds to the liver, preferably to hepatocytes, in vitro as well as in vivo\n* Any kind of compound, but in particular drugs, such as interferons, viral reverse transcriptase inhibitors or core assembly inhibitors, and\/or labels could possibly be specifically targeted and enriched in the liver using these peptides\n* Possible applications include: targeted diagnosis, prevention and\/or treatment of liver diseases or disorders.","published":"2014.12.05","region":null,"secondary_field":"Other","technology_readiness_level":"Pilot Scale","contact_phone":"+862865056429","sector":"Agriculture","title":"Hepatitis B virus peptides as vehicles for specific delivery of compounds to the liver","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"6 Months","By":"Wojciech Karmasz","country":"United States","contact_email":"xma@chinatis.com","contact_employer":"CITTC ISO","patent_info":"US Patent Pending 2011-0247937","implementation":"Water Treatment","intellectual_property_type":"Invention","keywords":"desalination, portable","market_prospect":null,"cooperation_type":"Joint Development,Joint Venture,Purchase of Project","contact_person":"Wojciech Karmasz","contact_organization":"Technology Licensing Office Massachusetts Institute of Technology","contact_organization_type":"Colleges & Universities","description":"* This technology is a low-cost process for water desalination using capacitive deionization.

Thus, this novel combination of growth factors has the potential to stabilize developing vasculature within the primary tumour site, limit vascular invasion, and subsequent metastasis.","published":"2014.11.01","region":null,"secondary_field":"Biotechnology","technology_readiness_level":"Not Available","contact_phone":"+86 10 82696139-812","sector":"Health Care","title":"Therapeutic Factors for the Mitigation of Cancer Metastasis","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"2 Years","By":"Caopanpan","country":"Canada","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_employer":"CITTC","patent_info":null,"implementation":null,"intellectual_property_type":"Not Provided","keywords":"protein, bacterial, biologic","market_prospect":null,"cooperation_type":"Other Mode","contact_person":"Caopanpan","contact_organization":"Worldiscoveries Asia Limited","contact_organization_type":"Overseas Company\/Agency","description":"Technical Requirements: Biologic Treatment of Sepsis\nThis biologic is a multi-faceted protein with potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-coagulant effects.

The concept is based on the cleaning of the secondary air flow induced by the supply air flow (Patent pending). In principle, the concept can be utilized in any supply air device or diffuser, but VTT has identified active chilled beams as the most promising application.\nAir conditioning systems based on the use of chilled beams have many advantages such as energy and space efficiency, and high cooling capacity. By integrating air cleaning into the chilled beams, the particle concentration in indoor air can be reduced by approximately 70%. Energy consumption of the new air cleaning solution is negligible.\nThe new air cleaning concept can be used in almost any kind of building (e.g. hotels, offices etc.). A significant advantage of this technique is that the indoor air quality can be improved in existing buildings without major changes in the ventilation system and without increasing air flow rates. Besides the air conditioning systems of buildings, the new concept can also be used to improve air quality in cruisers, trains and buses.","published":"2014.11.01","region":null,"secondary_field":"Energy Efficiency Building","technology_readiness_level":"Not Available","contact_phone":"+86 10 82696139-812","sector":"Building Construction","title":"New concept for improving","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"2 Years","By":"Caopanpan","country":"United Kingdom","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_employer":"CITTC","patent_info":null,"implementation":null,"intellectual_property_type":"Not Provided","keywords":"building materials","market_prospect":null,"cooperation_type":"Other Mode","contact_person":"Caopanpan","contact_organization":"Galliard Lockings Associates","contact_organization_type":"Overseas Company\/Agency","description":"S is a structural composite comprising two metal plates bonded with a polyurethane elastomer core.S is much simpler and more robust than stiffened steel plate and much lighter and faster to erect than reinforced concrete.S is used in a wide variety of applications including structural flooring, stadia and arena terraces, ship repair, shipbuilding and bridges.","published":"2014.11.01","region":null,"secondary_field":"Energy Efficiency Building","technology_readiness_level":"Not Available","contact_phone":"+86 10 82696139-812","sector":"Building Construction","title":"S-Polyurethane elastomer core building materials","meta_base_url":null,"meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"offer","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 19:01:59"},{"window":"2 Years","By":"Caopanpan","country":"Finland","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_employer":"CITTC","patent_info":null,"implementation":null,"intellectual_property_type":"Not Provided","keywords":"energy, bio, agricultural, paper","market_prospect":null,"cooperation_type":"Other Mode","contact_person":"Caopanpan","contact_organization":"Asia Pacific Headquarters Chempolis Biorefining Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.","contact_organization_type":"Overseas Company\/Agency","description":"Introduction\uff1aBy using bio refining technology to process agricultural residues and energy crops cultivated on marginal land, nonwood and non-food biomass could replace wood as the basis for papermaking and oil as the basis for liquid transportation fuels.\nChempolis\u2019state-of-the-art formico processes have been developed for biorefining non-wood and non-food materials, such as straw, grasses, bagasse, and many other residues.
