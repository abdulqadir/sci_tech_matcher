It is predicted that fossil fuel on the earth will be exhausted in the near future. At present, finding of alternative energy has attracted widespread attention in the world.\nBiomass is organic matter formed by direct or indirect photosynthesis of green plant. Biomass includes plant, animal, microorganism and their metabolite. It is a kind of renewable energy. The source of biomass is extensive. The reserve of biomass is fourth next to coal, oil and natural gas. It is predicted by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) that 60% of electric power and 40% of fuel will be provided by biomass in 2050s. In the various methods of biomass energy conversion technology, direct combustion is most feasible method of biomass utilization. Biomass is the unique fuel which is renewable and could be stored and transported directly. Meanwhile, it could achieve CO2 zero discharge. Worldwide researchers pay close attention to fluidized bed boiler (CFB) because of the advantages of alternative fuel, waste disposal and environment protection. Developing and designing CFB boiler utilizing biomass fuel has already become present research focus.\nCombustion test of typical biomass fuel was carried out on 1MWth CFB combustion test-rig of China Huaneng Clean Energy Research Institute (CERI). The special research on biomass fuel of fuel feeding, stable combustion characteristic, burnout characteristic, coking characteristic and gaseous pollutants(SO2, NOX, etc.) emission were carried out. The physico-chemical characteristic, combustion characteristic and pollutant emission characteristic have been mastered completely. The important theoretical basis was provided for industrialization of CFB boiler utilizing biomass fuel.\nThere are many problems such as thermodynamic calculation of boiler, stable combustion, feeding system, load capability of boiler, boiler thermal efficiency, corrosion of alkali metal and ash deposition in biomass fuel CFB boiler which have been put into commercial operation in China. Coking in dense phase zone, clogging in Loop seal system and starting deflagration occurred in individual power plants. According to above problems, there is wide cooperation requirement at home and abroad.","secondary_field":"Biomass","keywords":null,"cooperation_type":"Other Mode","contact_organization":"China Huaneng Group Clean Energy Technology Research Institute","contact_organization_type":"Overseas Company\/Agency","contact_person":"Caopanpan","contact_employer":"CITTC","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_phone":"+86 10 82696139-812","meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"request","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 18:43:33"},{"meta_base_url":"http:\/\/www.cittc.net\/anonym\/demandDetail\/518","title":"Introduction of International Cooperation Demand","sector":"Life Sciences and New Energy","published":"2014.11.01","window":"2 Years","country":"China","description":"Introduction of International Cooperation Demand:\nMolten carbonate fuel cell is a new generation of efficient and clean power generation technology and could combine with coal gasification technologies and gas turbine\u2019s power generation technologies to build IGFC combined cycle power generation system, with power generation efficiency above 65% and bright prospect.

Firstly, it intends to reform the existing mechanism. It uses desalted water instead of separated water from purified air for liquid-enriched flash steam washing. Then the separated water from the purified air is sent into a synthesizer for recycling. To make it easy to thoroughly replace the oily water from the purified gas separator or the water wash tower, the company positions the purified gas separator as well as the water wash tower desalted water replenishment function at the mouth of the purified gas & water washed circulating pump or the mouth of the recycled gas & water washed circulating pump. If after being technically reformed, the mechanism does not meet the requirements for environment protection, the company proceeds to the next step, that is, it decides to procure a new set of RCO-based (regenerative catalytic oxidizers) furnace or RTO-based (regenerative thermal oxidizers) furnace, including the automatic control system. The domestically made furnace costs about RMB 3 million Yuan while an imported one costs about RMB 5 million Yuan.Urgent Technical Problems:The company uses the two-stage flash evaporation technology for the phase-II carbon removal & solution recycling project to find a solution to the problem of excessive discharge of non-methane hydrocarbon. However, because it is at the design stage, the technology needs to be further tested when the phase-II project goes into operation. RCO-based or RTO-based furnace is the option because on one hand, it is difficult to technically reform the old mechanism with the two-stage flash evaporation technology (since there is no position for the secondary flash tank), and on the other hand, if it builds a new set of RCO-based or RTO-based furnace, the company not only thoroughly finds a solution to unqualified discharge of emissions, but also collects experiences for qualified discharge of large amount of decarbonized gas which is to be generated in the coal-to-liquids process when the phase-II project is put into operation. The detailed plan is to be made after the company consults Synfuels China and Nanjing Chemical Group Research Institute.Technical and Economic Indicators to Be Realized:Satisfy the requirements specified in Integrated Emission Standard of Air Pollutants (GB16297-1996), ensure the NMHC in the air pollutants contained in the current pollution sources is lower than 150mg\/m3.","secondary_field":"Other","keywords":"nmhc, exhaust gas regenerated, decarburization","cooperation_type":"Joint Development","contact_organization":"Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal-to-Oil Co., Ltd.","contact_organization_type":"Private Enterprise","contact_person":"caopanpan","contact_employer":"CITTC","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_phone":"+86 10-82696139-812","meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"request","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 18:43:33"},{"meta_base_url":"http:\/\/www.cittc.net\/anonym\/demandDetail\/297edff84a763b31014a7a21d2cf0007","title":"Comprehensive Utilization of Carbon Dioxide","sector":"Chemicals","published":"2014.12.24","window":"2 Years","country":"China","description":"Related Work Bases:The coal-to-chemical facility produces the byproduct of carbon dioxide, so the research on comprehensive of the carbon dioxide should be conducted while technical transformation, operation optimization, and elevation of coal conversion rate are conducted.Urgent Technical Problems:Deep-going conversion of carbon dioxideTechnical and Economic Indicators to Be Realized:Reduce carbon dioxide emissions.","secondary_field":"Other","keywords":"carbon dioxide","cooperation_type":"Joint Development","contact_organization":"Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal-to-Oil Co., Ltd.","contact_organization_type":"Private Enterprise","contact_person":"caopanpan","contact_employer":"CITTC","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_phone":"+86 10-82696139-812","meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"request","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 18:43:33"},{"meta_base_url":"http:\/\/www.cittc.net\/anonym\/demandDetail\/297edff84a763b31014a7a1fcc690006","title":"Removal of Isohydrocarbon and Olefin by Intermediate Products from Fischer-Tropsch Process","sector":"Chemicals","published":"2014.12.24","window":"2 Years","country":"China","description":"Related Work Bases:Although it is deeply processed, coal-based synthetic wax is dogged with the problem of excessive contents of isohydrocarbon and olefin, which affect performance of the wax.Urgent Technical Problems:Provided it does not damage the existing structure of the synthetic wax, the company decides to improve the quality as well as the use value of the synthetic wax by reducing the contents of isohydrocarbon and olefin.Technical and Economic Indicators to Be Realized:Reach or approach the Sasol wax standard.","secondary_field":"Other","keywords":"isohydrocarbon, olefin, fischer-tropsch","cooperation_type":"Joint Development","contact_organization":"Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal-to-Oil Co., Ltd.","contact_organization_type":"Private Enterprise","contact_person":"caopanpan","contact_employer":"CITTC","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_phone":"+86 10-82696139-812","meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"request","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 18:43:33"},{"meta_base_url":"http:\/\/www.cittc.net\/anonym\/demandDetail\/297edff84a763b31014a7a1c131b0005","title":"Coal-to-Chemicals, Coal Deep Processing, and Small Technical Transformation","sector":"Chemicals","published":"2014.12.24","window":"2 Years","country":"China","description":"Urgent Technical Problems:Coal-to-chemicals, coal deep processing, and small technical transformationTechnical and Economic Indicators to Be Realized:Be able to independently complete small technical transformation projects","secondary_field":"Other","keywords":"coal-to-chemicals, coal deep processing","cooperation_type":"Technical Service","contact_organization":"Inner Mongolia Yidong Group Dongfang Energy Chemical Co., Ltd.","contact_organization_type":"Private Enterprise","contact_person":"caopanpan","contact_employer":"CITTC","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_phone":"+86 10-82696139-812","meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"request","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 18:43:33"},{"meta_base_url":"http:\/\/www.cittc.net\/anonym\/demandDetail\/297edff84a763b31014a7a1983820004","title":"Production Processes and Technologies of PVB Membranes","sector":"Chemicals","published":"2014.12.24","window":"2 Years","country":"China","description":"Related Work Bases:At present, the company has specially built a building for the corporate technology center, the R&D center, the quality inspection center, and the pilot trail plant.

The Company is short of experience in operating the fluidized bed, so it plans to optimize the existing processes.","secondary_field":"Other","keywords":"optimize frb fluidized bed","cooperation_type":"Joint Development","contact_organization":"Guodian Inner Mongolia Jingyang Energy Co., Ltd.","contact_organization_type":"State-owned Enterprise","contact_person":"caopanpan","contact_employer":"CITTC","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_phone":"+86 10-82696139-812","meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"request","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 18:43:33"},{"meta_base_url":"http:\/\/www.cittc.net\/anonym\/demandDetail\/233","title":"swash plate axial plunger motor","sector":"Electronics","published":"2014.11.01","window":"2 Years","country":"China","description":"Technical support for swash plate axial plunger motor, including design principle, key technologies, materials, heat treatment, processing technologies, equipment and etc; experts of swash plate axial plunger motor; motor parameters including nominal displacement, rated revolution, maximum revolution, torque constant, output power, mechanical efficiency, volumetric efficiency (external leakage), startup efficiency, radial load, bearing lifespan, no-load lost pressure, retention characteristics and etc. \nPattern of cooperation \nCountries we wish to promote in or cooperate with: Japan, Germany, the USA, Italy and South Korea, \nSolve the problem we are facing at present: low quality of hydraulic motor products, low technical content and low value added through international cooperation with enterprises or individuals in Germany or Japan, develop independent intellectual property and industrialization, introduce products into the market to meet the needs of hydraulic motor for engineering machinery in China \nPurchase the complete package of technologies or introduce in key technologies and equipment","secondary_field":"Electronic Manufacturing","keywords":"motor, hydraulic, processing","cooperation_type":"Other Mode","contact_organization":"Beijing Collaborative Innovation Service League","contact_organization_type":"Overseas Company\/Agency","contact_person":"Caopanpan","contact_employer":"CITTC","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_phone":"+86 10 82696139-812","meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"request","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 18:43:33"},{"meta_base_url":"http:\/\/www.cittc.net\/anonym\/demandDetail\/232","title":"Glass Wine Bottle Lightweight Technologies","sector":"Agriculture","published":"2014.11.01","window":"2 Years","country":"China","description":"The weight volume ratio of lightweight glass bottles produced with international advanced technologies is generally in the range of 0.15~0.5 and that of domestic manufacturers and our Company is generally in the range of 0.5~1.2. When adopting the lightweight approach, we need to pay attention to improve physiochemical performances and other indexes of products and guarantee that product quality meets market requirements. With the lightweight technologies implemented, it will reduce greatly consumption of materials, produce more products and improve remarkably the economic benefits of an enterprise. Meanwhile, products with a smaller unit weight are also convenient for transportation. Particularly, road authorities have changed the management on over-limit transport to weight-based billing. The lightweight approach will reduce apparently the transportation cost and improve economic benefits of products, hence, greater market space. Domestic manufacturers have been tracking up actively the current development of this technology and are ready to reform anytime. We have controlled the weight volume ratio of lightweight glass containers to 0.15~0.5 and ensured improvement on physiochemical indexes of products by absorbing advanced technical experiences in the world, combining it with our actual situation and reforming existing production lines based on a reasonable gross input to meet the market demand. We plan to invest in CNY 5 million, including CNY 500K for purchase of technologies.","secondary_field":"Bio-agriculture","keywords":"wine","cooperation_type":"Other Mode","contact_organization":"Beijing Collaborative Innovation Service League","contact_organization_type":"Overseas Company\/Agency","contact_person":"Caopanpan","contact_employer":"CITTC","contact_email":"cpp@chinatis.com","contact_phone":"+86 10 82696139-812","meta_organization":"CITTC","meta_category":"request","meta_collected_date":"11\/09\/2017 18:43:33"}]
