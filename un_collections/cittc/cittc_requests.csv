In the production of precise filter and equipment, the filter should have leak hunting to ensure the quality and prevent liquid leakage. The method of filter leak detection is divided into two kinds: gas detection and water detection. But the accuracy of gas detection is not high and can not detect micro leak. Some gas detection equipment has high accuracy but can not use for a long time, which is not beneficial for the mass production. While water detection has high accuracy and short time, but the production should be dried after water detection.

From the beginning of 1970s, reserves of coal, oil and natural gas decreased rapidly because of large-scale exploitation. It is predicted that fossil fuel on the earth will be exhausted in the near future. At present, finding of alternative energy has attracted widespread attention in the world.
Biomass is organic matter formed by direct or indirect photosynthesis of green plant. Biomass includes plant, animal, microorganism and their metabolite. It is a kind of renewable energy. The source of biomass is extensive. The reserve of biomass is fourth next to coal, oil and natural gas. It is predicted by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) that 60% of electric power and 40% of fuel will be provided by biomass in 2050s. In the various methods of biomass energy conversion technology, direct combustion is most feasible method of biomass utilization. Biomass is the unique fuel which is renewable and could be stored and transported directly. Meanwhile, it could achieve CO2 zero discharge. Worldwide researchers pay close attention to fluidized bed boiler (CFB) because of the advantages of alternative fuel, waste disposal and environment protection. Developing and designing CFB boiler utilizing biomass fuel has already become present research focus.
Combustion test of typical biomass fuel was carried out on 1MWth CFB combustion test-rig of China Huaneng Clean Energy Research Institute (CERI). The special research on biomass fuel of fuel feeding, stable combustion characteristic, burnout characteristic, coking characteristic and gaseous pollutants(SO2, NOX, etc.) emission were carried out. The physico-chemical characteristic, combustion characteristic and pollutant emission characteristic have been mastered completely. The important theoretical basis was provided for industrialization of CFB boiler utilizing biomass fuel.
There are many problems such as thermodynamic calculation of boiler, stable combustion, feeding system, load capability of boiler, boiler thermal efficiency, corrosion of alkali metal and ash deposition in biomass fuel CFB boiler which have been put into commercial operation in China. Coking in dense phase zone, clogging in Loop seal system and starting deflagration occurred in individual power plants. According to above problems, there is wide cooperation requirement at home and abroad.",Biomass,,Other Mode,China Huaneng Group Clean Energy Technology Research Institute,Overseas Company/Agency,Caopanpan,CITTC,cpp@chinatis.com,+86 10 82696139-812,CITTC,request,11/09/2017 18:43:33

Firstly, it intends to reform the existing mechanism. It uses desalted water instead of separated water from purified air for liquid-enriched flash steam washing. Then the separated water from the purified air is sent into a synthesizer for recycling. To make it easy to thoroughly replace the oily water from the purified gas separator or the water wash tower, the company positions the purified gas separator as well as the water wash tower desalted water replenishment function at the mouth of the purified gas & water washed circulating pump or the mouth of the recycled gas & water washed circulating pump. If after being technically reformed, the mechanism does not meet the requirements for environment protection, the company proceeds to the next step, that is, it decides to procure a new set of RCO-based (regenerative catalytic oxidizers) furnace or RTO-based (regenerative thermal oxidizers) furnace, including the automatic control system. The domestically made furnace costs about RMB 3 million Yuan while an imported one costs about RMB 5 million Yuan.Urgent Technical Problems:The company uses the two-stage flash evaporation technology for the phase-II carbon removal & solution recycling project to find a solution to the problem of excessive discharge of non-methane hydrocarbon. However, because it is at the design stage, the technology needs to be further tested when the phase-II project goes into operation. RCO-based or RTO-based furnace is the option because on one hand, it is difficult to technically reform the old mechanism with the two-stage flash evaporation technology (since there is no position for the secondary flash tank), and on the other hand, if it builds a new set of RCO-based or RTO-based furnace, the company not only thoroughly finds a solution to unqualified discharge of emissions, but also collects experiences for qualified discharge of large amount of decarbonized gas which is to be generated in the coal-to-liquids process when the phase-II project is put into operation. The detailed plan is to be made after the company consults Synfuels China and Nanjing Chemical Group Research Institute.Technical and Economic Indicators to Be Realized:Satisfy the requirements specified in Integrated Emission Standard of Air Pollutants (GB16297-1996), ensure the NMHC in the air pollutants contained in the current pollution sources is lower than 150mg/m3.",Other,"nmhc, exhaust gas regenerated, decarburization",Joint Development,"Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal-to-Oil Co., Ltd.",Private Enterprise,caopanpan,CITTC,cpp@chinatis.com,+86 10-82696139-812,CITTC,request,11/09/2017 18:43:33
